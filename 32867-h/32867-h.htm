<p>&#8220;And can this be my own world?</p>
<p class='indent2'>&#8217;Tis all gold and snow,</p>
<p>Save where scarlet waves are hurled</p>

<p class='indent2'>Hath many worlds more.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>A boy</span>, whom I knew very well, was once
going through a meadow, which was full of
buttercups. The nurse and his baby sister were
with him; and when they got to an old hawthorn,
which grew in the hedge and was covered with
blossom, they all sat down in its shade, and the
nurse took out three slices of plum-cake, gave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
one to each of the children, and kept one for
herself.</p>
<p>While the boy was eating, he observed that this
hedge was very high and thick, and that there
was a great hollow in the trunk of the old thorn-tree,
and he heard a twittering, as if there was
a nest somewhere inside; so he thrust his head in,
twisted himself round, and looked up.</p>
<p>It was a very great thorn-tree, and the hollow
was so large that two or three boys could have
stood upright in it; and when he got used to the
dim light in that brown, still place, he saw that a
good way above his head there was a nest,&mdash;rather
a curious one, too, for it was as large as a
pair of blackbirds would have built,&mdash;and yet it
was made of fine white wool and delicate bits of
moss; in short, it was like a goldfinch&#8217;s nest magnified
three times.</p>
<p>Just then he thought he heard some little voices
cry, &#8220;Jack! Jack!&#8221; His baby sister was asleep,
and the nurse was reading a story-book, so it could
not have been either of them who called. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
must get in here,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;I wish this hole
was larger.&#8221; So he began to wriggle and twist
himself through, and just as he pulled in his last
foot, he looked up, and three heads which had
been peeping over the edge of the nest suddenly
popped down again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those heads had no beaks, I am sure,&#8221; said
Jack, and he stood on tiptoe and poked in one
of his fingers. &#8220;And the things have no feathers,&#8221;
he continued; so, the hollow being rather rugged,
he managed to climb up and look in.</p>
<p>His eyes were not used yet to the dim light;
but he was sure those things were not birds,&mdash;no.
He poked them, and they took no notice; but
when he snatched one of them out of the nest,
it gave a loud squeak, and said, &#8220;O don&#8217;t, Jack!&#8221;
as plainly as possible, upon which he was so
frightened that he lost his footing, dropped the
thing, and slipped down himself. Luckily, he
was not hurt, nor the thing either; he could see
it quite plainly now: it was creeping about like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
rather an old baby, and had on a little frock and
pinafore.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fairy!&#8221; exclaimed Jack to himself.
&#8220;How curious! and this must be a fairy&#8217;s nest.
Oh, how angry the old mother will be if this little
thing creeps away and gets out of the hole!&#8221;
So he looked down. &#8220;Oh, the hole is on the
other side,&#8221; he said; and he turned round, but the
hole was not on the other side; it was not on any
side; it must have closed up all on a sudden,
while he was looking into the nest, for, look
whichever way he would, there was no hole at all,
excepting a very little one high up over the nest,
which let in a very small sunbeam.</p>
<p>Jack was very much astonished, but he went
on eating his cake, and was so delighted to see
the young fairy climb up the side of the hollow
and scramble again into her nest, that he laughed
heartily; upon which all the nestlings popped up
their heads, and, showing their pretty white teeth,
pointed at the slice of cake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;I may have to stay inside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
here for a long time, and I have nothing to eat but
this cake; however, your mouths are very small,
so you shall have a piece;&#8221; and he broke off a
small piece, and put it into the nest, climbing up
to see them eat it.</p>
<p>These young fairies were a long time dividing
and munching the cake, and before they had finished,
it began to be rather dark, for a black cloud
came over and covered the little sunbeam. At the
same time the wind rose, and rocked the boughs,
and made the old tree creak and tremble. Then
there was thunder and rain, and the little fairies
were so frightened that they got out of the nest
and crept into Jack&#8217;s pockets. One got into each
waistcoat pocket, and the other two were very
comfortable, for he took out his handkerchief and
made room for them in the pocket of his jacket.</p>
<p>It got darker and darker, till at last Jack could
only just see the hole, and it seemed to be a very
long way off. Every time he looked at it, it was
farther off, and at last he saw a thin crescent moon
shining through it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I am sure it cannot be night yet,&#8221; he said; and
he took out one of the fattest of the young fairies,
and held it up towards the hole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at that,&#8221; said he; &#8220;what is to be done
now? the hole is so far off that it&#8217;s night up
there, and down here I haven&#8217;t done eating my
lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered the young fairy, &#8220;then why
don&#8217;t you whistle?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack was surprised to hear her speak in this
sensible manner, and in the light of the moon he
looked at her very attentively.</p>
<p>&#8220;When first I saw you in the nest,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;you had a pinafore on, and now you have a
smart little apron, with lace round it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is because I am much older now,&#8221; said
the fairy; &#8220;we never take such a long time to
grow up as you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But your pinafore?&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Turned into an apron, of course,&#8221; replied the
fairy, &#8220;just as your velvet jacket will turn into a
tail-coat when you are old enough.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes it will,&#8221; answered the fairy, with an air
of superior wisdom. &#8220;Don&#8217;t argue with me; I
am older now than you are,&mdash;nearly grown up,
in fact. Put me into your pocket again, and whistle
as loudly as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack laughed, put her in, and pulled out another.
&#8220;Worse and worse,&#8221; he said; &#8220;why, this was a
boy fairy, and now he has a mustache and a sword,
and looks as fierce as possible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I heard my sister tell you to whistle?&#8221;
said this fairy, very sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she did,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Well, I suppose
I had better do it.&#8221; So he whistled very loudly
indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you leave off so soon?&#8221; said another
of them, peeping out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, if you wish to know,&#8221; answered Jack,
&#8220;it was because I thought something took hold
of my legs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ridiculous child!&#8221; cried the last of the four,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
&#8220;how do you think you are ever to get out, if she
doesn&#8217;t take hold of your legs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack thought he would rather have done a
long-division sum than have been obliged to
whistle; but he could not help doing it when
they told him, and he felt something take hold
of his legs again, and then give him a jerk,
which hoisted him on to its back, where he sat
astride, and wondered whether the thing was a
pony; but it was not, for he presently observed
that it had a very slender neck, and then that
it was covered with feathers. It was a large bird,
and he presently found that they were rising
towards the hole, which had become so very far
off, and in a few minutes she dashed through the
hole, with Jack on her back and all the fairies
in his pockets.</p>
<p>It was so dark that he could see nothing, and
he twined his arms round the bird&#8217;s neck, to hold
on, upon which this agreeable fowl told him not
to be afraid, and said she hoped he was comfortable.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I should be more comfortable,&#8221; replied Jack,
&#8220;if I knew how I could get home again. I don&#8217;t
wish to go home just yet, for I want to see where
we are flying to, but papa and mamma will be
frightened if I never do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; replied the albatross (for she was an
albatross), &#8220;you need not be at all afraid about
that. When boys go to Fairyland, their parents
never are uneasy about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; exclaimed Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite true,&#8221; replied the albatross.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so we are going to Fairyland?&#8221; exclaimed
Jack; &#8220;how delightful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the albatross; &#8220;the back way,
mind; we are only going the back way. You
could go in two minutes by the usual route; but
these young fairies want to go before they are
summoned, and therefore you and I are taking
them.&#8221; And she continued to fly on in the dark
sky for a very long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;They seem to be all fast asleep,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they will sleep till we come to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
wonderful river,&#8221; replied the albatross; and just
then she flew with a great bump against something
that met her in the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;What craft is this that hangs out no light?&#8221;
said a gruff voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might ask the same question of you,&#8221; answered
the albatross, sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only a poor Will-o&#8217;-the-wisp,&#8221; replied the
voice, &#8220;and you know very well that I have but a
lantern to show.&#8221; Thereupon a lantern became
visible, and Jack saw by the light of it a man,
who looked old and tired, and he was so transparent
that you could see through him, lantern
and all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I have not hurt you, William,&#8221; said
the albatross; &#8220;I will light up immediately. Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; answered the Will-o&#8217;-the-wisp.
&#8220;I am going down as fast as I can; the storm
blew me up, and I am never easy excepting in my
native swamps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack might have taken more notice of Will,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
if the albatross had not begun to light up. She
did it in this way. First, one of her eyes began
to gleam with a beautiful green light, which cast
its rays far and near, and then, when it was as
bright as a lamp, the other eye began to shine, and
the light of that eye was red. In short, she was
lighted up just like a vessel at sea.</p>
<p>Jack was so happy that he hardly knew which
to look at first, there really were so many remarkable
things.</p>
<p>&#8220;They snore,&#8221; said the albatross, &#8220;they are very
fast asleep, and before they wake I should like to
talk to you a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>She meant that the fairies snored, and so they
did, in Jack&#8217;s pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name,&#8221; continued the albatross, &#8220;is Jenny.
Do you think you shall remember that? because,
when you are in Fairyland and want some one to
take you home again, and call &#8216;Jenny,&#8217; I shall be
able to come to you; and I shall come with pleasure,
for I like boys better than fairies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Oh yes, I shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
remember your name, it is such a very easy
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is in the night that you want me, just
look up,&#8221; continued the albatross, &#8220;and you will
see a green and a red spark moving in the air;
you will then call Jenny, and I will come; but
remember that I cannot come unless you do call
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Jack; but he was not attending,
because there was so much to be seen.</p>
<p>In the first place, all the stars excepting a few
large ones were gone, and they looked frightened;
and as it got lighter, one after the other seemed to
give a little start in the blue sky and go out. And
then Jack looked down and saw, as he thought, a
great country, covered with very jagged snow
mountains with astonishingly sharp peaks. Here
and there he saw a very deep lake,&mdash;at least he
thought it was a lake; but while he was admiring
the mountains, there came an enormous crack
between two of the largest, and he saw the sun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
come rolling up among them, and it seemed to be
almost smothered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, those are clouds!&#8221; exclaimed Jack;
&#8220;and O how rosy they have all turned! I thought
they were mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are clouds,&#8221; said the albatross; and
then they turned gold color; and next they began
to plunge and tumble, and every one of the peaks
put on a glittering crown; and next they broke
themselves to pieces, and began to drift away. In
fact, Jack had been out all night, and now it was
morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />CAPTAIN JACK.</h2>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It has been our lot to sail with many captains, not one
of whom is fit to be a patch on your back.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Letter of
the Ship&#8217;s Company of H. M. S. S. Royalist to Captain
W. T. Bate.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>All</span> this time the albatross kept dropping
down and down like a stone, till Jack was
quite out of breath, and they fell or flew, whichever
you like to call it, straight through one of the
great chasms which he had thought were lakes,
and he looked down, as he sat on the bird&#8217;s back,
to see what the world is like when you hang a
good way above it at sunrise.</p>
<p>It was a very beautiful sight; the sheep and
lambs were still fast asleep on the green hills, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
the sea-birds were asleep in long rows upon the
ledges of the cliffs, with their heads under their
wings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are those young fairies awake yet?&#8221; asked the
albatross.</p>
<p>&#8220;As sound asleep as ever,&#8221; answered Jack;
&#8220;but, Albatross, is not that the sea which lies
under us? You are a sea-bird, I know, but I am
not a sea boy, and I cannot live in the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is the sea,&#8221; answered the albatross.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you observe that it is covered with ships?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see boats and vessels,&#8221; answered Jack, &#8220;and
all their sails are set, but they cannot sail, because
there is no wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind never does blow in this great bay,&#8221;
said the bird; &#8220;and those ships would all lie there
becalmed till they dropped to pieces if one of
them was not wanted now and then to go up
the wonderful river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did they come there?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them had captains who ill-used their
cabin-boys, some were pirate ships, and others
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
were going out on evil errands. The consequence
was, that when they chanced to sail within this
great bay they got becalmed; the fairies came and
picked all the sailors out and threw them into the
water; they then took away the flags and pennons
to make their best coats of, threw the ship-biscuits
and other provisions to the fishes, and set all the
sails. Many ships which are supposed by men to
have foundered lie becalmed in this quiet sea.
Look at those five grand ones with high prows;
they are moored close together; they were part of
the Spanish Armada: and those open boats with
blue sails belonged to the Romans; they sailed
with C&#230;sar when he invaded Britain.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time the albatross was hovering about
among the vessels, making choice of one to take
Jack and the fairies up the wonderful river.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must not be a large one,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for the
river in some places is very shallow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack would have liked very much to have a
fine three-master, all to himself; but then he considered
that he did not know anything about sails
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
and rigging; he thought it would be just as well
to be contented with whatever the albatross might
choose, so he let her set him down in a beautiful
little open boat, with a great carved figure-head to
it. There he seated himself in great state, and the
albatross perched herself on the next bench, and
faced him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember my name?&#8221; asked the albatross.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said Jack; but he was not attending,&mdash;he
was thinking what a fine thing it was to
have such a curious boat all to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s well,&#8221; answered the bird; &#8220;then, in the
next place, are those fairies awake yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they are not,&#8221; said Jack; and he took
them out of his pockets, and laid them down in a
row before the albatross.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are certainly asleep,&#8221; said the bird.
&#8220;Put them away again, and take great care of
them. Mind you don&#8217;t lose any of them, for I
really don&#8217;t know what will happen if you do.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
Now I have one thing more to say to you, and that
is, are you hungry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; replied the albatross, &#8220;as soon as you
feel <i>very</i> hungry, lie down in the bottom of the boat
and go to sleep. You will dream that you see
before you a roasted fowl, some new potatoes, and
an apple-pie. Mind you don&#8217;t eat too much in
your dream, or you will be sorry for it when you
wake. That is all. Good-by! I must go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack put his arms round the neck of the bird,
and hugged her; then she spread her magnificent
wings and sailed slowly away. At first he felt
very lonely, but in a few minutes he forgot that,
because the little boat began to swim so fast.</p>
<p>She was not sailing, for she had no sail, and he
was not rowing, for he had no oars; so I am
obliged to call her motion swimming, because I
don&#8217;t know of a better word. In less than a quarter
of an hour they passed close under the bows of a
splendid three-decker, a seventy-gun ship. The
gannets who live in those parts had taken possession
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
of her, and she was so covered with nests that
you could not have walked one step on her deck
without treading on them. The father birds were
aloft in the rigging, or swimming in the warm,
green sea, and they made such a clamor when they
saw Jack that they nearly woke the fairies,&mdash;nearly,
but not quite, for the little things turned
round in Jack&#8217;s pockets, and sneezed, and began
to snore again.</p>
<p>Then the boat swam past a fine brig. Some sea
fairies had just flung her cargo overboard, and
were playing at leap-frog on deck. These were
not at all like Jack&#8217;s own fairies; they were about
the same height and size as himself, and they had
brown faces, and red flannel shirts and red caps
on. A large fleet of the pearly nautilus was collected
close under the vessel&#8217;s lee. The little
creatures were feasting on what the sea fairies had
thrown overboard, and Jack&#8217;s boat, in its eagerness
to get on, went plunging through them so
roughly that several were capsized. Upon this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
the brown sea fairies looked over, and called out
angrily, &#8220;Boat ahoy!&#8221; and the boat stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell that boat of yours to mind what she is
about,&#8221; said the fairy sea-captain to Jack.</p>
<p>Jack touched his hat, and said, &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; and
then called out to his boat, &#8220;You ought to be
ashamed of yourself, running down these little
live fishing-vessels so carelessly. Go at a more
gentle pace.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it swam more slowly; and Jack, being by
this time hungry, curled himself up in the bottom
of the boat, and fell asleep.</p>
<p>He dreamt directly about a fowl and some potatoes,
and he ate a wing, and then he ate a merry-thought,
and then somebody said to him that he
had better not eat any more, but he did,&mdash;he ate
another wing; and presently an apple-pie came,
and he ate some of that, and then he ate some
more, and then he immediately woke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that bird told me not to eat too much,&#8221;
said Jack, &#8220;and yet I have done it. I never felt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
so full in my life;&#8221; and for more than half an hour
he scarcely noticed anything.</p>
<p>At last he lifted up his head, and saw straight
before him two great brown cliffs, and between
them flowed in the wonderful river. Other rivers
flow out, but this river flowed in, and took with it
far into the land dolphins, sword-fish, mullet, sun-fish,
and many other strange creatures; and that is
one reason why it was called the magic river, or
the wonderful river.</p>
<p>At first it was rather wide, and Jack was
alarmed to see what multitudes of soldiers stood
on either side to guard the banks, and prevent any
person from landing.</p>
<p>He wondered how he should get the fairies on
shore. However, in about an hour the river
became much narrower, and then Jack saw that
the guards were not real soldiers, but rose-colored
flamingoes. There they stood, in long regiments,
among the reeds, and never stirred. They are the
only foot-soldiers the fairies have in their pay;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
they are very fierce, and never allow anything but
a fairy ship to come up the river.</p>
<p>They guarded the banks for miles and miles,
many thousands of them, standing a little way into
the water among the flags and rushes; but at last
there were no more reeds and no soldier guards,
for the stream became narrower, and flowed
between such steep rocks that no one could possibly
have climbed them.</p>

<p class='indent8'>&#8220;Tick, tick, tick!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Jack</span> looked at these hot, brown rocks, first on
the left bank and then on the right, till he was
quite tired; but at last the shore on the right bank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
became flat, and he saw a beautiful little bay,
where the water was still, and where grass grew
down to the brink.</p>
<p>He was so much pleased at this change, that he
cried out hastily, &#8220;Oh how I wish my boat would
swim into that bay and let me land!&#8221; He had
no sooner spoken than the boat altered her course,
as if somebody had been steering her, and began
to make for the bay as fast as she could go.</p>
<p>&#8220;How odd!&#8221; thought Jack. &#8220;I wonder whether
I ought to have spoken; for the boat certainly did
not intend to come into this bay. However, I
think I will let her alone now, for I certainly do
wish very much to land here.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they drew towards the strand, the water got
so shallow that you could see crabs and lobsters
walking about at the bottom. At last the boat&#8217;s
keel grated on the pebbles; and just as Jack
began to think of jumping on shore, he saw two
little old women approaching, and gently driving
a white horse before them.</p>
<p>The horse had panniers, one on each side; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
when his feet were in the water he stood still; and
Jack said to one of the old women,&mdash;&#8220;Will you
be so kind as to tell me whether this is Fairyland?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does he say?&#8221; asked one old woman of
the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked if this was Fairyland?&#8221; repeated Jack,
for he thought the first old woman might have
been deaf. She was very handsomely dressed in a
red satin gown, and did not look in the least like a
washer-woman, though it afterwards appeared that
she was one.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says, &#8216;Is this Fairyland?&#8217;&#8221; she replied;
and the other, who had a blue satin cloak, answered,
&#8220;Oh, does he?&#8221; and then they began to
empty the panniers of many small blue, and pink,
and scarlet shirts, and coats, and stockings; and
when they had made them into two little heaps
they knelt down and began to wash them in the
river, taking no notice of him whatever.</p>
<p>Jack stared at them. They were not much taller
than himself, and they were not taking the slightest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
care of their handsome clothes; then he looked
at the old white horse, who was hanging his head
over the lovely clear water with a very discontented
air.</p>
<p>At last the blue washer-woman said, &#8220;I shall
leave off now; I&#8217;ve got a pain in my works.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go home and
have a cup of tea.&#8221; Then she glanced at Jack,
who was still sitting in the boat, and said, &#8220;Can
you strike?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can if I choose,&#8221; replied Jack, a little astonished
at this speech. And the red and blue
washer-women wrung out the clothes, put them
again into the panniers, and taking the old horse
by the bridle, began gently to lead him away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a great mind to land,&#8221; thought Jack.
&#8220;I should not wonder at all if this is Fairyland.
So as the boat came here to please me, I shall ask
it to stay where it is, in case I should want it
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he sprang ashore, and said to the boat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
&#8220;Stay just where you are, will you?&#8221; and he ran
after the old women, calling to them,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any law to prevent my coming into
your country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wo!&#8221; cried the red-coated old woman, and
the horse stopped, while the blue-coated woman
repeated, &#8220;Any law? No, not that I know of;
but if you are a stranger here you had better look
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose, do you,&#8221; she answered,
&#8220;that our Queen will wind up strangers?&#8221;</p>
<p>While Jack was wondering what she meant, the
other said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if he goes eight days.
Gee!&#8221; and the horse went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, wo!&#8221; said the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no. Gee! I tell you,&#8221; cried the first.</p>
<p>Upon this, to Jack&#8217;s intense astonishment, the
old horse stopped, and said, speaking through his
nose,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then, which is it to be? I&#8217;m willing to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
gee, and I&#8217;m agreeable to wo; but what&#8217;s a fellow
to do when you say them both together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he talks!&#8221; exclaimed Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because he&#8217;s got a cold in his head,&#8221;
observed one of the washer-women; &#8220;he always
talks when he&#8217;s got a cold, and there&#8217;s no pleasing
him; whatever you say, he&#8217;s not satisfied. Gee,
Boney, do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee it is, then,&#8221; said the horse, and began to
jog on.</p>
<p>&#8220;He spoke again!&#8221; said Jack, upon which the
horse laughed, and Jack was quite alarmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears that your horses don&#8217;t talk?&#8221;
observed the blue-coated woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; answered Jack; &#8220;they can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean they won&#8217;t,&#8221; observed the old horse;
and though he spoke the words of mankind, it was
not in a voice like theirs. Still Jack felt that his
was just the natural tone for a horse, and that it
did not arise only from the length of his nose.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll find out some day, perhaps,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;whether horses can talk or not.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Shall I?&#8221; said Jack, very earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll <span class='smcaplc'>TELL</span>,&#8221; proceeded the white horse.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be you when they tell how you&#8217;ve
used them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been ill used?&#8221; said Jack, in an
anxious tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, of course he has,&#8221; one of the women
broke in; &#8220;but he has come here to get all right
again. This is a very wholesome country for
horses; isn&#8217;t it, Boney?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, jog on, there&#8217;s a dear,&#8221; continued
the old woman. &#8220;Why, you will be young again
soon, you know,&mdash;young, and gamesome, and
handsome; you&#8217;ll be quite a colt, by and by, and
then we shall set you free to join your companions
in the happy meadows.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old horse was so comforted by this kind
speech, that he pricked up his ears and quickened
his pace considerably.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was shamefully used,&#8221; observed one washer-woman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
&#8220;Look at him, how lean he is! You
can see all his ribs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the other, as if apologizing for the
poor old horse. &#8220;He gets low-spirited when he
thinks of all he has gone through; but he is a vast
deal better already than he was. He used to live
in London; his master always carried a long whip
to beat him with, and never spoke civilly to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;London!&#8221; exclaimed Jack; &#8220;why that is in
my country. How did the horse get here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no business of yours,&#8221; answered one of
the women. &#8220;But I can tell you he came because
he was wanted, which is more than you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You let him alone,&#8221; said the horse, in a querulous
tone. &#8220;I don&#8217;t bear any malice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; he has a good disposition, has Boney,&#8221;
observed the red old woman. &#8220;Pray, are you a
boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;A real boy, that wants no winding up?&#8221;
inquired the old woman.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean,&#8221; answered Jack;
&#8220;but I am a real boy, certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Well, I thought you
were, by the way Boney spoke to you. How
frightened you must be! I wonder what will be
done to all your people for driving, and working,
and beating so many beautiful creatures to death
every year that comes? They&#8217;ll have to pay for it
some day, you may depend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack was a little alarmed, and answered that he
had never been unkind himself to horses, and he
was glad that Boney bore no malice.</p>
<p>&#8220;They worked him, and often drove him about
all night in the miserable streets, and never let him
have so much as a canter in a green field,&#8221; said
one of the women; &#8220;but he&#8217;ll be all right now,
only he has to begin at the wrong end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, in this country,&#8221; answered the old
woman, &#8220;they begin by being terribly old and
stiff, and they seem miserable and jaded at first,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
but by degrees they get young again, as you heard
me reminding him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;and do you like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has nothing to do with me,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;We are only here to take care of all the creatures
that men have ill used. While they are sick and
old, which they are when first they come to us,&mdash;after
they are dead, you know,&mdash;we take care of
them, and gradually bring them up to be young
and happy again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This must be a very nice country to live in,
then,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;For horses it is,&#8221; said the old lady, significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;it does seem very full of
haystacks, certainly, and all the air smells of fresh
grass.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this moment they came to a beautiful
meadow, and the old horse stopped, and, turning
to the blue-coated woman, said, &#8220;Faxa, I think I
could fancy a handful of clover.&#8221; Upon this Faxa
snatched Jack&#8217;s cap off his head, and in a very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
active manner jumped over a little ditch, and
gathering some clover, presently brought it back
full, handing it to the old horse with great civility.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t be in such a hurry,&#8221; observed
the old horse; &#8220;your weights will be running
down some day, if you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all zeal,&#8221; observed the red-coated woman.</p>
<p>Just then a little man, dressed like a groom,
came running up, out of breath. &#8220;Oh, here you
are, Dow!&#8221; he exclaimed to the red-coated woman.
&#8220;Come along, will you? Lady Betty wants you;
it&#8217;s such a hot day, and nobody, she says, can fan
her so well as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>The red-coated woman, without a word, went
off with the groom, and Jack thought he would
go with them, for this Lady Betty could surely tell
him whether the country was called Fairyland, or
whether he must get into his boat and go farther.
He did not like either to hear the way in which
Faxa and Dow talked about their works and their
weights; so he asked Faxa to give him his cap,
which she did, and he heard a curious sort of little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
ticking noise as he came close to her, which
startled him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this must be Fairyland, I am sure,&#8221;
thought Jack, &#8220;for in my country our pulses beat
quite differently from that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Faxa, rather sharply, &#8220;do you find
any fault with the way I go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jack, a little ashamed of having listened.
&#8220;I think you walk beautifully; your steps
are so regular.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s machine-made,&#8221; observed the old horse,
in a melancholy voice, and with a deep sigh. &#8220;In
the largest magnifying-glass you&#8217;ll hardly find the
least fault with her chain. She&#8217;s not like the
goods they turn out in Clerkenwell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack was more and more startled, and so glad
to get his cap and run after the groom and Dow
to find Lady Betty, that he might be with ordinary
human beings again; but when he got up to them,
he found that Lady Betty was a beautiful brown
mare! She was lying in a languid and rather
affected attitude, with a load of fresh hay before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
her, and two attendants, one of whom stood holding
a parasol over her head, and the other was
fanning her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you are come, my good Dow,&#8221;
said the brown mare. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I am
strong enough to-day to set off for the happy
meadows?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Dow, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not yet; you
must remember that it is of no use your leaving
us till you have quite got over the effects of the
fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then Lady Betty observed Jack, and said,
&#8220;Take that boy away; he reminds me of a
jockey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The attentive groom instantly started forward,
but Jack was too nimble for him; he ran and ran
with all his might, and only wished he had never
left the boat. But still he heard the groom behind
him; and in fact the groom caught him at last,
and held him so fast that struggling was of no use
at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;You young rascal!&#8221; he exclaimed, as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
recovered breath. &#8220;How you do run! It&#8217;s
enough to break your mainspring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What harm did I do?&#8221; asked Jack. &#8220;I was
only looking at the mare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harm!&#8221; exclaimed the groom; &#8220;harm indeed!
Why, you reminded her of a jockey. It&#8217;s enough
to hold her back, poor thing!&mdash;and we trying so
hard, too, to make her forget what a cruel end she
came to in the old world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not hold me so tightly,&#8221; said Jack,
&#8220;I shall not run away again; but,&#8221; he added, &#8220;if
this is Fairyland, it is not half such a nice country
as I expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairyland!&#8221; exclaimed the groom, stepping
back with surprise. &#8220;Why, what made you think
of such a thing? This is only one of the border
countries, where things are set right again that
people have caused to go wrong in the world. The
world, you know, is what men and women call
their own home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;and that&#8217;s where I
came from.&#8221; Then, as the groom seemed no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
longer to be angry, he went on: &#8220;And I wish you
would tell me about Lady Betty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was a beautiful fleet creature, of the racehorse
breed,&#8221; said the groom; &#8220;and she won
silver cups for her master, and then they made her
run a steeple-chase, which frightened her, but still
she won it; and then they made her run another,
and she cleared some terribly high hurdles, and
many gates and ditches, till she came to an awful
one, and at first she would not take it, but her rider
spurred and beat her till she tried. It was beyond
her powers, and she fell and broke both her forelegs.
Then they shot her. After she had died
that miserable death, we had her here, to make her
all right again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this the only country where you set things
right?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; answered the groom; &#8220;they
lie about in all directions. Why, you might wander
for years, and never come to the end of this
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid I shall not find the one I am looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
for,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;if your countries are so
large.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think our world is much larger than
yours,&#8221; answered the groom. &#8220;But come along:
I hear the bell, and we are a good way from the
palace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack, in fact, heard the violent ringing of a bell
at some distance; and when the groom began to
run, he ran beside him, for he thought he should
like to see the palace. As they ran, people gathered
from all sides,&mdash;fields, cottages, mills,&mdash;till
at last there was a little crowd, among whom Jack
saw Dow and Faxa, and they were all making for
a large house, the wide door of which was standing
open. Jack stood with the crowd, and peeped
in. There was a woman sitting inside upon a
rocking-chair,&mdash;a tall, large woman, with a gold-colored
gown on,&mdash;and beside her stood a table,
covered with things that looked like keys.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that woman doing?&#8221; said he to Faxa,
who was standing close to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Winding us up, to be sure,&#8221; answered Faxa.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose, surely, that we can go forever?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Extraordinary!&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Then are you
wound up every evening, like watches?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless we have misbehaved ourselves,&#8221; she
answered; &#8220;and then she lets us run down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221; repeated Faxa, &#8220;why, then we
have to stop and stand against a wall, till she is
pleased to forgive us, and let our friends carry us
in to be set going again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack looked in, and saw the people pass in and
stand close by the woman. One after the other
she took by the chin with her left hand, and with
her right hand found a key that pleased her. It
seemed to Jack that there was a tiny key-hole in
the back of their heads, and that she put the key
in and wound them up.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must take your turn with the others,&#8221; said
the groom.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no key-hole in my head,&#8221; said Jack;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
&#8220;besides, I do not want any woman to wind
me up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must do as others do,&#8221; he persisted;
&#8220;and if you have no key-hole, our Queen can
easily have one made, I should think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make one in my head!&#8221; exclaimed Jack.
&#8220;She shall do no such thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall see,&#8221; said Faxa, quietly. And Jack
was so frightened that he set off, and ran back
towards the river with all his might. Many of
the people called to him to stop, but they could
not run after him, because they wanted winding
up. However, they would certainly have caught
him if he had not been very quick, for before he
got to the river he heard behind him the footsteps
of those who had been first attended to by the
Queen, and he had only just time to spring into
the boat when they reached the edge of the water.</p>
<p>No sooner was he on board than the boat swung
round, and got out again into the middle of the
stream; but he could not feel safe till not only was
there a long reach of water between him and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
shore, but till he had gone so far down the river
that the beautiful bay had passed out of sight, and
the sun was going down. By this time he began
to feel very tired and sleepy; so, having looked at
his fairies, and found that they were all safe and
fast asleep, he laid down in the bottom of the boat,
and fell into a doze, and then into a dream.</p>

</div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>The dove laid some little sticks,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Then began to coo;</p>
<p>The gnat took his trumpet up</p>
<p class='indent2'>To play the day through;</p>
<p>The pie chattered soft and long&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>But that she always does;</p>
<p>The bee did all he had to do,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And only said, &#8220;Buzz.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>When</span> Jack at length opened his eyes, he
found that it was night, for the full moon
was shining; but it was not at all a dark night, for
he could see distinctly some black birds, that
looked like ravens. They were sitting in a row on
the edge of the boat.</p>
<p>Now that he had fairies in his pockets, he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
understand bird-talk, and he heard one of these
ravens saying, &#8220;There is no meat so tender; I
wish I could pick their little eyes out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said another, &#8220;fairies are delicate eating
indeed. We must speak Jack fair if we want
to get at them.&#8221; And she heaved up a deep sigh.</p>
<p>Jack lay still, and thought he had better pretend
to be asleep; but they soon noticed that his eyes
were open, and one of them presently walked up
his leg and bowed, and asked if he was hungry.</p>
<p>Jack said, &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more am I,&#8221; replied the raven; &#8220;not at all
hungry.&#8221; Then she hopped off his leg, and Jack
sat up.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how are the sweet fairies that my young
master is taking to their home?&#8221; asked another
of the ravens. &#8220;I hope they are safe in my young
master&#8217;s pockets?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack felt in his pockets. Yes, they were all
safe; but he did not take any of them out, lest the
ravens should snatch at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; continued the raven, pretending to listen;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
&#8220;did this dear young gentleman say that the
fairies were asleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t amuse me to talk about fairies,&#8221; said
Jack; &#8220;but if you would explain some of the
things in this country that I cannot make out, I
should be very glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What things?&#8221; asked the blackest of the ravens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;I see a full moon lying
down there among the water-flags, and just going
to set, and there is a half-moon overhead plunging
among those great gray clouds, and just this
moment I saw a thin crescent moon peeping out
between the branches of that tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said all the ravens at once, &#8220;did the
young master never see a crescent moon in the
men and women&#8217;s world?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he never see a full moon?&#8221; asked the
ravens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;but they are the
same moon. I could never see all three of them
at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>The ravens were very much surprised at this,
and one of them said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;If my young master did not see the moons it
must have been because he didn&#8217;t look. Perhaps
my young master slept in a room, and had only
one window; if so, he couldn&#8217;t see all the sky at
once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, Raven,&#8221; said Jack, laughing, &#8220;that
I <span class='smcaplc'>KNOW</span> there is never more than one moon in
my country, and sometimes there is no moon at
all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon this all the ravens hung down their
heads, and looked very much ashamed; for there
is nothing that birds hate so much as to be laughed
at, and they believed that Jack was saying this to
mock them, and that he knew what they had
come for. So first one and then another hopped
to the other end of the boat and flew away, till at
last there was only one left, and she appeared to
be out of spirits, and did not speak again till he
spoke to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Raven,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;there&#8217;s something very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
cold and slippery lying at the bottom of the boat.
I touched it just now, and I don&#8217;t like it at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a water-snake,&#8221; said the raven; and she
stooped and picked up a long thing with her
beak, which she threw out, and then looked over.
&#8220;The water swarms with them, wicked, murderous
creatures; they smell the young fairies, and
they want to eat them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack was so thrown off his guard that he snatched
one fairy out, just to make sure that it was safe.
It was the one with the mustache; and, alas! in
one instant the raven flew at it, got it out of his
hand, and pecked off its head before it had time
to wake or Jack to rescue it. Then, as she slowly
rose, she croaked, and said to Jack, &#8220;You&#8217;ll catch
it for this, my young master!&#8221; and she flew to
the bough of a tree, where she finished eating the
fairy, and threw his little empty coat into the
river.</p>
<p>On this Jack began to cry bitterly, and to think
what a foolish boy he had been. He was the
more sorry because he did not even know that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
poor little fellow&#8217;s name. But he had heard the
others calling by name to their companions, and
very grand names they were too. One was
Jovinian,&mdash;he was a very fierce-looking gentleman;
the other two were Roxaletta and Mopsa.</p>
<p>Presently, however, Jack forgot to be unhappy,
for two of the moons went down, and then the
sun rose, and he was delighted to find that however
many moons there might be, there was only
one sun, even in the country of the wonderful
river.</p>
<p>So on and on they went; but the river was
very wide, and the waves were boisterous. On
the right brink was a thick forest of trees, with
such heavy foliage that a little way off they looked
like a bank, green, and smooth, and steep; but
as the light became clearer, Jack could see here
and there the great stems, and see creatures like
foxes, wild boars, and deer, come stealing down
to drink in the river.</p>
<p>It was very hot here; not at all like the spring
weather he had left behind. And as the low
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
sunbeams shone into Jack&#8217;s face he said hastily,
without thinking of what would occur, &#8220;I wish
I might land among those lovely glades on the
left bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>No sooner said than the boat began to make
for the left bank, and the nearer they got towards
it the more beautiful it became; but also the more
stormy were the reaches of water they had to
traverse.</p>
<p>A lovely country indeed! It sloped gently
down to the water&#8217;s edge, and beautiful trees
were scattered over it, soft, mossy grass grew
everywhere, great old laburnum trees stretched
their boughs down in patches over the water,
and higher up camellias, almost as large as hawthorns,
grew together and mingled their red and
white flowers.</p>
<p>The country was not so open as a park,&mdash;it
was more like a half-cleared woodland; but there
was a wide space just where the boat was steering
for, that had no trees, only a few flowering shrubs.
Here groups of strange-looking people were bustling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
about, and there were shrill fifes sounding,
and drums.</p>
<p>Farther back he saw rows of booths or tents
under the shade of the trees.</p>
<p>In another place some people dressed like
gypsies had made fires of sticks just at the skirts
of the woodland, and were boiling their pots.
Some of these had very gaudy tilted carts, hung
all over with goods, such as baskets, brushes,
mats, little glasses, pottery, and beads.</p>
<p>It seemed to be a kind of fair, to which people
had gathered from all parts; but there was not
one house to be seen. All the goods were either
hung upon trees or collected in strange-looking
tents.</p>
<p>The people were not all of the same race;
indeed, he thought the only human beings were
the gypsies, for the folks who had tents were no
taller than himself.</p>
<p>How hot it was that morning! and as the boat
pushed itself into a little creek, and made its way
among the beds of yellow and purple iris which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
skirted the brink, what a crowd of dragon-flies
and large butterflies rose from them!</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay where you are!&#8221; cried Jack to the boat;
and at that instant such a splendid moth rose
slowly, that he sprang on shore after it, and quite
forgot the fair and the people in his desire to
follow it.</p>
<p>The moth settled on a great red honey-flower,
and he stole up to look at it. As large as a
swallow, it floated on before him. Its wings were
nearly black, and they had spots of gold on them.</p>
<p>When it rose again Jack ran after it, till he
found himself close to the rows of tents where
the brown people stood; and they began to cry
out to him, &#8220;What&#8217;ll you buy? what&#8217;ll you buy,
sir?&#8221; and they crowded about him, so that he
soon lost sight of the moth, and forgot everything
else in his surprise at the booths.</p>
<p>They were full of splendid things,&mdash;clocks and
musical boxes, strange china ornaments, embroidered
slippers, red caps, and many kinds of
splendid silks and small carpets. In other booths
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
were swords and dirks, glittering with jewels;
and the chatter of the people when they talked
together was not in a language that Jack could
understand.</p>
<p>Some of the booths were square, and evidently
made of common canvas, for when you went into
them, and the sun shone, you could distinctly see
the threads.</p>
<p>But scattered a little farther on in groups were
some round tents, which were far more curious.
They were open on all sides, and consisted only
of a thick canopy overhead, which was supported
by one beautiful round pillar in the middle.</p>
<p>Outside the canopy was white or brownish;
but when Jack stood under these tents, he saw
that they were lined with splendid flutings of
brown or pink silk: what looked like silk, at
least, for it was impossible to be sure whether
these were real tents or gigantic mushrooms.</p>
<p>They varied in size, also, as mushrooms do,
and in shape: some were large enough for twenty
people to stand under them, and had flat tops
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
with a brown lining; others had dome-shaped
roofs; these were lined with pink, and would
only shelter six or seven.</p>
<p>The people who sold in these tents were as
strange as their neighbors; each had a little high
cap on his head, in shape just like a beehive, and
it was made of straw, and had a little hole in
front. In fact, Jack very soon saw bees flying in
and out, and it was evident that these people had
their honey made on the premises. They were
chiefly selling country produce. They had cheeses
so large as to reach to their waists, and the
women trundled them along as boys do their
hoops. They sold a great many kinds of seed,
too, in wooden bowls, and cakes and good things
to eat, such as gilt gingerbread. Jack bought
some of this, and found it very nice indeed. But
when he took out his money to pay for it, the little
man looked rather strangely at it, and turned it
over with an air of disgust. Then Jack saw him
hand it to his wife, who also seemed to dislike
it; and presently Jack observed that they followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
him about, first on one side, then on the other.
At last, the little woman slipped her hand into
his pocket, and Jack, putting his hand in directly,
found his sixpence had been returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;ve given me back my money!&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>The little woman put her hands behind her.
&#8220;I do not like it,&#8221; she said; &#8220;it&#8217;s dirty; at least,
it&#8217;s not new.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not new,&#8221; said Jack, a good deal
surprised, &#8220;but it is a good sixpence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bees don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; continued the little
woman. &#8220;They like things to be neat and new,
and that sixpence is bent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I give you then?&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>The good little woman laughed and blushed.
&#8220;This young gentleman has a beautiful whistle
round his neck,&#8221; she observed, politely, but did
not ask for it.</p>
<p>Jack had a dog-whistle, so he took it off and
gave it to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for the bees,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
love to be called home when we&#8217;ve collected
flowers for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she made a pretty little courtesy, and went
away to her customers.</p>
<p>There were some very strange creatures also,
about the same height as Jack, who had no tents,
and seemed there to buy, not to sell. Yet they
looked poorer than the other folks, and they were
also very cross and discontented; nothing pleased
them. Their clothes were made of moss, and
their mantles of feathers; and they talked in a
queer whistling tone of voice, and carried their
skinny little children on their backs and on their
shoulders.</p>
<p>They were treated with great respect by the
people in the tents; and when Jack asked his
friend to whom he had given the whistle what they
were, and where they got so much money as they
had, she replied that they lived over the hills, and
were afraid to come in their best clothes. They
were rich and powerful at home, and they came
shabbily dressed, and behaved humbly, lest their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
enemies should envy them. It was very dangerous,
she said, to fairies to be envied.</p>
<p>Jack wanted to listen to their strange whistling
talk, but he could not for the noise and cheerful
chattering of the brown folks, and more still for
the screaming and talking of parrots.</p>
<p>Among the goods were hundreds of splendid
gilt cages, which were hung by long gold chains
from the trees. Each cage contained a parrot and
his mate, and they all seemed to be very unhappy
indeed.</p>
<p>The parrots could talk, and they kept screaming
to the discontented women to buy things for them,
and trying very hard to attract attention.</p>
<p>One old parrot made himself quite conspicuous
by these efforts. He flung himself against the
wires of his cage, he squalled, he screamed, he
knocked the floor with his beak, till Jack and one
of the customers came running up to see what was
the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make such a fuss for?&#8221; cried the
discontented woman. &#8220;You&#8217;ve set your cage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
swinging with knocking yourself about; and what
good does that do? I cannot break the spell and
open it for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; answered the parrot, sobbing;
&#8220;but it hurts my feelings so that you should take
no notice of me now that I have come down in the
world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the parrot&#8217;s mate, &#8220;it hurts our
feelings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t forgotten you,&#8221; answered the woman,
more crossly than ever; &#8220;I was buying a measure
of maize for you when you began to make such a
noise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack thought this was the queerest conversation
he had ever heard in his life; and he was still more
surprised when the bird answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would much rather you would buy me a
pocket-handkerchief. Here we are, shut up, without
a chance of getting out, and with nobody to
pity us; and we can&#8217;t even have the comfort of
crying, because we&#8217;ve got nothing to wipe our eyes
with.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But at least,&#8221; replied the woman, &#8220;you <span class='smcaplc'>CAN</span>
cry now if you please, and when you had your
other face you could not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Buy me a handkerchief,&#8221; sobbed the parrot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t afford both,&#8221; whined the cross woman,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ve paid now for the maize.&#8221; So saying,
she went back to the tent to fetch her present to
the parrots; and as their cage was still swinging
Jack put out his hand to steady it for them, and
the instant he did so they became perfectly silent,
and all the other parrots on that tree, who had
been flinging themselves about in their cages, left
off screaming, and became silent too.</p>
<p>The old parrot looked very cunning. His cage
hung by such a long gold chain that it was just on
a level with Jack&#8217;s face, and so many odd things
had happened that day that it did not seem more
odd than usual to hear him say, in a tone of great
astonishment,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a <span class='smcaplc'>BOY</span>, if ever there was one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;I&#8217;m a boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t go yet, will you?&#8221; said the parrot.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t,&#8221; said a great many other parrots.
Jack agreed to stay a little while, upon which they
all thanked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no notion you were a boy till you touched
my cage,&#8221; said the old parrot.</p>
<p>Jack did not know how this could have told
him, so he only answered, &#8220;Indeed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a fairy,&#8221; observed the parrot, in a confidential
tone. &#8220;We are imprisoned here by our
enemies the gypsies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So we are,&#8221; answered a chorus of other parrots.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for that,&#8221; replied Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;m friends
with the fairies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell,&#8221; said the parrot, drawing a film
over his eyes, and pretending to be asleep. At
that moment his friend in the moss petticoat and
feather cloak came up with a little measure of
maize, and poured it into the cage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, neighbor,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I must say good-by
now, for the gypsy is coming this way, and I
want to buy some of her goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, thank you,&#8221; answered the parrot, sobbing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
again; &#8220;but I could have wished it had been
a pocket-handkerchief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lend you my handkerchief,&#8221; said Jack.
&#8220;Here!&#8221; And he drew it out, and pushed it
between the wires.</p>
<p>The parrot and his wife were in a great hurry
to get Jack&#8217;s handkerchief. They pulled it in very
hastily; but instead of using it they rolled it up
into a ball, and the parrot-wife tucked it under
her wing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes me tremble all over,&#8221; said she, &#8220;to
think of such good luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; observed the parrot to Jack, &#8220;I know
all about it now. You&#8217;ve got some of my people
in your pockets,&mdash;not of my own tribe, but
fairies.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this Jack was sure that the parrot really was
a fairy himself, and he listened to what he had to
say the more attentively.</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent8'>That handkerchief</p>

<p>She was a charmer, and could almost read</p>
<p>The thoughts of people.&mdash;<i>Othello.</i></p>
</div></div>
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class='drop'>T</span><span class='dcap'>hat</span> gypsy woman who is coming with her
cart,&#8221; said the parrot, &#8220;is a fairy too, and
very malicious. It was she and others of her tribe
who caught us and put us into these cages, for they
are more powerful than we. Mind you do not let
her allure you into the woods, nor wheedle you
or frighten you into giving her any of those
fairies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;I will not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She sold us to the brown people,&#8221; continued
the parrot. &#8220;Mind you do not buy anything of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
her, for your money in her palm would act as a
charm against you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has a baby,&#8221; observed the parrot-wife,
scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a baby,&#8221; repeated the old parrot; &#8220;and I
hope by means of that baby to get her driven
away, and perhaps get free myself. I shall try to
put her in a passion. Here she comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>There she was indeed, almost close at hand.
She had a little cart; her goods were hung all
about it, and a small horse drew it slowly on,
and stopped when she got a customer.</p>
<p>Several gypsy children were with her, and as
the people came running together over the grass
to see her goods, she sang a curious kind of song,
which made them wish to buy them.</p>
<p>Jack turned from the parrot&#8217;s cage as she came
up. He had heard her singing a little way off,
and now, before she began again, he felt that
already her searching eyes had found him out,
and taken notice that he was different from the
other people.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></div>
<p>When she began to sing her selling song, he felt
a most curious sensation. He felt as if there were
some cobwebs before his face, and he put up his
hand as if to clear them away. There were no
real cobwebs, of course; and yet he again felt as
if they floated from the gypsy woman to him, like
gossamer threads, and attracted him towards her.
So he gazed at her, and she at him, till Jack
began to forget how the parrot had warned him.</p>
<p>He saw her baby too, wondered whether it was
heavy for her to carry, and wished he could help
her. I mean, he saw that she had a baby on her
arm. It was wrapped in a shawl, and had a handkerchief
over its face. She seemed very fond of
it, for she kept hushing it; and Jack softly moved
nearer and nearer to the cart, till the gypsy woman
smiled, and suddenly began to sing,&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>My good man&mdash;he&#8217;s an old, old man</p>
<p class='indent2'>And my good man got a fall,</p>
<p>To buy me a bargain so fast he ran</p>
<p class='indent2'>When he heard the gypsies call:</p>
<p class='indent6'>&#8220;Buy, buy brushes,</p>
<p class='indent6'>Baskets wrought o&#8217; rushes.</p>
<p class='indent6'>Buy them, buy them, take them, try them,</p>
<p class='indent12'>Buy, dames all.&#8221;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>My old man, he has money and land,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And a young, young wife am I.</p>
<p>Let him put the penny in my white hand</p>
<p class='indent2'>When he hears the gypsies cry:</p>
<p class='indent6'>&#8220;Buy, buy laces,</p>
<p class='indent6'>Veils to screen your faces.</p>
<p class='indent6'>Buy them, buy them, take and try them.</p>
<p class='indent12'>Buy, maids, buy.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>When the gypsy had finished her song, Jack
felt as if he was covered all over with cobwebs;
but he could not move away, and he did not mind
them now. All his wish was to please her, and
get close to her; so when she said, in a soft,
wheedling voice, &#8220;What will you please to buy,
my pretty gentleman?&#8221; he was just going to
answer that he would buy anything she recommended,
when, to his astonishment and displeasure,
for he thought it very rude, the parrot
suddenly burst into a violent fit of coughing,
which made all the customers stare. &#8220;That&#8217;s to
clear my throat,&#8221; he said, in a most impertinent
tone of voice; and then he began to beat time with
his foot, and sing, or rather scream out, an extremely
saucy imitation of the gypsy&#8217;s song, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
all his parrot friends in the other cages joined in
the chorus.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>My fair lady&#8217;s a dear, dear lady&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>I walked by her side to woo.</p>
<p>In a garden alley, so sweet and shady,</p>
<p class='indent2'>She answered, &#8220;I love not you,</p>
<p class='indent6'>John, John Brady,&#8221;</p>
<p class='indent6'>Quoth my dear lady,</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray now, pray now, go your way now,</p>
<p class='indent6'>Do, John, do!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>At first the gypsy did not seem to know where
that mocking song came from, but when she discovered
that it was her prisoner, the old parrot,
who was thus daring to imitate her, she stood
silent and glared at him, and her face was almost
white with rage.</p>
<p>When he came to the end of the verse he pretended
to burst into a violent fit of sobbing and
crying, and screeched out to his wife, &#8220;Mate!
mate! hand up my handkerchief. Oh! oh! it&#8217;s
so affecting, this song is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon this the other parrot pulled Jack&#8217;s handkerchief
from under her wing, hobbled up, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
began, with a great show of zeal, to wipe his
horny beak with it. But this was too much for
the gypsy; she took a large brush from her cart,
and flung it at the cage with all her might.</p>
<p>This set it violently swinging backwards and
forwards, but did not stop the parrot, who
screeched out, &#8220;How delightful it is to be
swung!&#8221; And then he began to sing another
verse in the most impudent tone possible, and
with a voice that seemed to ring through Jack&#8217;s
head, and almost pierce it:&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Yet my fair lady&#8217;s my own, own lady,</p>
<p class='indent2'>For I passed another day;</p>
<p>While making her moan, she sat all alone,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And thus and thus did she say:</p>
<p class='indent6'>&#8220;John, John Brady,&#8221;</p>
<p class='indent6'>Quoth my dear lady,</p>
<p>&#8220;Do now, do now, once more woo now,</p>
<p class='indent6'>Pray, John, pray!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beautiful!&#8221; screeched the parrot-wife,
&#8220;and so ap-pro-pri-ate.&#8221;  Jack was delighted
when she managed slowly to say this long word
with her black tongue, and he burst out laughing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
In the mean time a good many of the brown
people came running together, attracted by the
noise of the parrots and the rage of the gypsy,
who flung at his cage, one after the other, all the
largest things she had in her cart. But nothing
did the parrot any harm; the more violently his
cage swung, the louder he sang, till at last the
wicked gypsy seized her poor little young baby,
who was lying in her arms, rushed frantically
at the cage as it flew swiftly through the air
towards her, and struck at it with the little creature&#8217;s
head. &#8220;Oh, you cruel, cruel woman!&#8221;
cried Jack, and all the small mothers who were
standing near with their skinny children on their
shoulders, screamed out with terror and indignation;
but only for one instant, for the handkerchief
flew off that had covered its face, and was
caught in the wires of the cage, and all the people
saw that it was not a real baby at all, but a
bundle of clothes, and its head was a turnip.</p>
<p>Yes, a turnip! You could see that as plainly
as possible, for though the green leaves had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
cut off, their stalks were visible through the lace
cap that had been tied on it.</p>
<p>Upon this all the crowd pressed closer, throwing
her baskets, and brushes, and laces, and beads
at the gypsy, and calling out, &#8220;We will have none
of your goods, you false woman! Give us back
our money, or we will drive you out of the fair.
You&#8217;ve stuck a stick into a turnip, and dressed it
up in baby clothes. You&#8217;re a cheat! a cheat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My sweet gentlemen, my kind ladies,&#8221; began
the gypsy; but baskets and brushes flew at her
so fast that she was obliged to sit down on the
grass and hold up the sham baby to screen her
face.</p>
<p>While this was going on, Jack felt that the
cobwebs which had seemed to float about his face
were all gone; he did not care at all any more
about the gypsy, and began to watch the parrots
with great attention.</p>
<p>He observed that when the handkerchief stuck
between the cage wires, the parrots caught it,
and drew it inside; and then Jack saw the cunning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
old bird himself lay it on the floor, fold
it crosswise like a shawl, and put it on his
wife.</p>
<p>Then she jumped upon the perch, and held it
with one foot, looking precisely like an old lady
with a parrot&#8217;s head. Then he folded Jack&#8217;s
handkerchief in the same way, put it on, and got
upon the perch beside his wife, screaming out, in
his most piercing tone,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like shawls; they&#8217;re so becoming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the gypsy did not care at all what those
inferior people thought of her, and she was calmly
counting out their money, to return it; but she
was very desirous to make Jack forget her behavior,
and had begun to smile again, and tell
him she had only been joking, when the parrot
spoke, and, looking up, she saw the two birds
sitting side by side, and the parrot-wife was
screaming in her mate&#8217;s ear, though neither of
them was at all deaf,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Jack lets her allure him into the woods,
he&#8217;ll never come out again. She&#8217;ll hang him up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
in a cage, as she did us. I say, how does my
shawl fit?&#8221;</p>
<p>So saying, the parrot-wife whisked herself round
on the perch, and lo! in the corner of the handkerchief
were seen some curious letters, marked
in red. When the crowd saw these, they drew a
little farther off, and glanced at one another with
alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look charming, my dear; it fits well!&#8221;
screamed the old parrot in answer. &#8220;A word
in your ear; &#8216;Share and share alike&#8217; is a fine
motto.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by all this?&#8221; said the
gypsy, rising, and going with slow steps to the
cage, and speaking cautiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; said the parrot, &#8220;do they ever eat
handkerchiefs in your part of the country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, never,&#8221; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue and be reasonable,&#8221; said
the gypsy, trembling. &#8220;What do you want?
I&#8217;ll do it, whatever it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But do they never pick out the marks?&#8221; continued
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
the parrot. &#8220;O Jack! are you sure they
never pick out the marks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The marks?&#8221; said Jack, considering. &#8220;Yes,
perhaps they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried the gypsy, as the old parrot
made a peck at the strange letters. &#8220;Oh! you&#8217;re
hurting me. What do you want? I say again,
tell me what you want, and you shall have
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to get out,&#8221; replied the parrot;
&#8220;you must undo the spell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then give me my handkerchief,&#8221; answered
the gypsy, &#8220;to bandage my eyes. I dare not
say the words with my eyes open. You had no
business to steal it. It was woven by human
hands, so that nobody can see through it; and
if you don&#8217;t give it to me, you&#8217;ll never get out,&mdash;no,
never!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the old parrot, tossing his shawl
off, &#8220;you may have Jack&#8217;s handkerchief; it will
bandage your eyes just as well. It was woven
over the water, as yours was.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t do!&#8221; cried the gypsy, in terror;
&#8220;give me my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; answered the parrot, &#8220;that you
shall have Jack&#8217;s handkerchief; you can do no
harm with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time the parrots all around had become
perfectly silent, and none of the people ventured
to say a word, for they feared the malice of the
gypsy. She was trembling dreadfully, and her
dark eyes, which had been so bright and piercing,
had become dull and almost dim; but when she
found there was no help for it, she said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, pass out Jack&#8217;s handkerchief. I will
set you free if you will bring out mine with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Share and share alike,&#8221; answered the parrot;
&#8220;you must let all my friends out too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I won&#8217;t let you out,&#8221; answered the
gypsy. &#8220;You shall come out first, and give me
my handkerchief, or not one of their cages will I
undo. So take your choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends, then,&#8221; answered the brave old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
parrot; and he poked Jack&#8217;s handkerchief out
to her through the wires.</p>
<p>The wondering crowd stood by to look, and
the gypsy bandaged her eyes tightly with the
handkerchief; and then, stooping low, she began
to murmur something and clap her hands&mdash;softly
at first, but by degrees more and more violently.
The noise was meant to drown the words she
muttered; but as she went on clapping, the bottom
of cage after cage fell clattering down. Out flew
the parrots by hundreds, screaming and congratulating
one another; and there was such a deafening
din that not only the sound of her spell, but the
clapping of her hands, was quite lost in it.</p>
<p>But all this time Jack was very busy; for the
moment the gypsy had tied up her eyes, the old
parrot snatched the real handkerchief off his wife&#8217;s
shoulders, and tied it round her neck. Then she
pushed out her head through the wires, and the
old parrot called to Jack, and said, &#8220;Pull!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack took the ends of the handkerchief, pulled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
terribly hard, and stopped. &#8220;Go on! go on!&#8221;
screamed the old parrot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall pull her head off,&#8221; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; cried the parrot; &#8220;no matter,&mdash;only
pull.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Jack did pull, and he actually did pull her
head off! nearly tumbling backward himself as he
did it; but he saw what the whole thing meant
then, for there was another head inside,&mdash;a fairy&#8217;s
head.</p>
<p>Jack flung down the old parrot&#8217;s head and great
beak, for he saw that what he had to do was to
clear the fairy of its parrot covering. The poor
little creature seemed nearly dead, it was so terribly
squeezed in the wires. It had a green gown
or robe on, with an ermine collar; and Jack got
hold of this dress, stripped the fairy out of the
parrot feathers, and dragged her through,&mdash;velvet
robe, and crimson girdle, and little yellow shoes.
She was very much exhausted, but a kind brown
woman took her instantly, and laid her in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
bosom. She was a splendid little creature, about
half a foot long.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a brave boy!&#8221; cried the parrot. Jack
glanced round, and saw that not all the parrots
were free yet, the gypsy was still muttering her
spell.</p>
<p>He returned the handkerchief to the parrot,
who put it round his own neck, and again Jack
pulled. But oh! what a tough old parrot that
was, and how Jack tugged before his cunning head
would come off! It did, however, at last; and
just as a fine fairy was pulled through, leaving his
parrot skin and the handkerchief behind him, the
gypsy untied her eyes, and saw what Jack had
done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me my handkerchief!&#8221; she screamed, in
despair.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in the cage, gypsy,&#8221; answered Jack; &#8220;you
can get it yourself. Say your words again.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the gypsy&#8217;s spell would only open places
where she had confined fairies, and no fairies were
in the cage now.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, no, no!&#8221; she screamed; &#8220;too late! Hide
me! O good people, hide me!&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was indeed too late. The parrots had
been wheeling in the air, hundreds and hundreds
of them, high above her head; and as she ceased
speaking, she fell shuddering on the ground, drew
her cloak over her face, and down they came,
swooping in one immense flock, and settled so
thickly all over her that she was completely covered;
from her shoes to her head not an atom of
her was to be seen.</p>
<p>All the people stood gravely looking on. So
did Jack, but he could not see much for the
fluttering of the parrots, nor hear anything for
their screaming voices; but at last he made one
of the cross people hear when he shouted to
her, &#8220;What are they going to do to the poor
gypsy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make her take her other form,&#8221; she replied;
&#8220;and then she cannot hurt us while she stays
in our country. She is a fairy, as we have just
found out, and all fairies have two forms.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Jack; but he had no time for more
questions.</p>
<p>The screaming and fighting, and tossing about
of little bits of cloth and cotton, ceased; a black
lump heaved itself up from the ground among
the parrots; and as they flew aside, an ugly
great condor, with a bare neck, spread out its
wings, and, skimming the ground, sailed slowly
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have pecked her so that she can hardly
rise,&#8221; exclaimed the parrot fairy. &#8220;Set me
on your shoulder, Jack, and let me see the end
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack set him there; and his little wife, who
had recovered herself, sprang from her friend the
brown woman, and sat on the other shoulder.
He then ran on,&mdash;the tribe of brown people and
mushroom people, and the feather-coated folks
running too,&mdash;after the great black bird, who
skimmed slowly on before them till she got to the
gypsy carts, when out rushed the gypsies, armed
with poles, milking-stools, spades, and everything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
they could get hold of to beat back the people
and the parrots from hunting their relation, who
had folded her tired wings, and was skulking
under a cart, with ruffled feathers and a scowling
eye.</p>
<p>Jack was so frightened at the violent way in
which the gypsies and the other tribes were
knocking each other about, that he ran off, thinking
he had seen enough of such a dangerous
country.</p>
<p>As he passed the place where that evil-minded
gypsy had been changed, he found the ground
strewed with little bits of her clothes. Many
parrots were picking them up, and poking them
into the cage where the handkerchief was; and
presently another parrot came with a lighted
brand, which she had pulled from one of the
gypsies&#8217; fires.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said the fairy on Jack&#8217;s shoulder,
when he saw his friend push the brand
between the wires of what had been his cage,
and set the gypsy&#8217;s handkerchief on fire, and all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
the bits of her clothes with it. &#8220;She won&#8217;t find
much of herself here,&#8221; he observed, as Jack went
on. &#8220;It will not be very easy to put herself together
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Jack moved away. He was tired of the
noise and confusion; and the sun was just setting
as he reached the little creek where his boat
lay.</p>
<p>Then the parrot fairy and his wife sprang
down, and kissed their hands to him as he
stepped on board, and pushed the boat off. He
saw, when he looked back, that a great fight was
still going on; so he was glad to get away, and
he wished his two friends good-by, and set off,
the old parrot fairly calling after him, &#8220;My relations
have put some of our favorite food on board
for you.&#8221; Then they again thanked him for his
good help, and sprang into a tree, and the boat
began to go down the wonderful river.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been a most extraordinary day,&#8221;
thought Jack; &#8220;the strangest day I have had yet.&#8221;
And after he had eaten a good supper of what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
the parrots had brought, he felt so tired and
sleepy that he laid down in the boat, and presently
fell fast asleep. His fairies were sound
asleep too in his pockets, and nothing happened
of the least consequence; so he slept comfortably
till morning.</p>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;For, oh! she has a sweet tongue,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And een that look down,</p>
<p>A gold girdle for her waist,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And a purple gown.</p>
<p>She has a good word forbye</p>
<p class='indent2'>Fra a&#8217; folk in the town.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Soon</span> after sunrise they came to a great city,
and it was perfectly still. There were grand
towers and terraces, wharves, too, and a large
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
market, but there was nobody anywhere to be
seen. Jack thought that might be because it was
so early in the morning; and when the boat ran
itself up against a wooden wharf and stopped, he
jumped ashore, for he thought this must be the
end of his journey. A delightful town it was,
if only there had been any people in it! The
market-place was full of stalls, on which were
spread toys, baskets, fruit, butter, vegetables, and
all the other things that are usually sold in a
market.</p>
<p>Jack walked about in it. Then he looked in
at the open doors of the houses, and at last,
finding that they were all empty, he walked into
one, looked at the rooms, examined the picture-books,
rang the bells, and set the musical-boxes
going. Then, after he had shouted a good deal,
and tried in vain to make some one hear, he went
back to the edge of the river where his boat was
lying, and the water was so delightfully clear and
calm, that he thought he would bathe. So he
took off his clothes, and folding them very carefully,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
so as not to hurt the fairies, laid them down
beside a hay-cock, and went in, and ran about
and paddled for a long time,&mdash;much longer than
there was any occasion for; but then he had
nothing to do.</p>
<p>When at last he had finished, he ran to the
hay-cock and began to dress himself; but he could
not find his stockings, and after looking about for
some time he was obliged to put on his clothes
without them, and he was going to put his boots
on his bare feet, when, walking to the other side
of the hay-cock, he saw a little old woman about
as large as himself. She had a pair of spectacles
on, and she was knitting.</p>
<p>She looked so sweet-tempered that Jack asked
her if she knew anything about his stockings.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be time enough to ask for them when
you have had your breakfast,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Sit
down. Welcome to our town. How do you
like it?&#8221;</p>

JACK&#8217;S NEW FRIEND.<br />

&#8220;She had a pair of spectacles on, and she was knitting.&#8221;&mdash;<span class='smcap'><a href='#page_82'>Page 82</a>.</span><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I should like it very much indeed,&#8221; said
Jack, &#8220;if there was anybody in it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that,&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
seen a good deal of it; but it pleases me to find
that you are a very honest boy. You did not
take anything at all. I am honest too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;of course you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And as I am pleased with you for being
honest,&#8221; continued the little woman, &#8220;I shall
give you some breakfast out of my basket.&#8221; So
she took out a saucer full of honey, a roll of
bread, and a cup of milk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;but I am not a
beggar-boy; I have got a half-crown, a shilling,
a sixpence, and two pence; so I can buy this
breakfast of you, if you like. You look very
poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I?&#8221; said the little woman, softly; and
she went on knitting, and Jack began to eat the
breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what has become of my stockings,&#8221;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will never see them any more,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
the old woman. &#8220;I threw them into the river,
and they floated away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>The little woman took no notice; but presently
she had finished a beautiful pair of stockings,
and she handed them to Jack, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that like the pair you lost?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;these are much more
beautiful stockings than mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like them as well?&#8221; asked the fairy
woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like them much better,&#8221; said Jack, putting
them on. &#8220;How clever you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to wear these,&#8221; said the
woman, &#8220;instead of yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave Jack such a strange look when she
said this, that he was afraid to take them, and
answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t like to wear them if you think I
had better not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I am very honest, as
I told you; and therefore I am obliged to say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
that if I were you I would not wear those stockings
on any account.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said Jack; for she looked so
sweet-tempered that he could not help trusting
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; repeated the fairy; &#8220;why, because
when you have those stockings on, your
feet belong to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Well, if you think that
matters, I&#8217;ll take them off again. Do you think
it matters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the fairy woman; &#8220;it matters,
because I am a slave, and my master can make
me do whatever he pleases, for I am completely
in his power. So, if he found out that I had
knitted these stockings for you, he would make
me order you to walk into his mill,&mdash;the mill
which grinds the corn for the town; and there
you would have to grind and grind till I got
free again.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Jack heard this, he pulled off the beautiful
stockings, and laid them on the old woman&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
lap. Upon this she burst out crying, as if her
heart would break.</p>
<p>&#8220;If my fairies that I have in my pocket would
only wake,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;I would fight your master;
for if he is no bigger than you are, perhaps
I could beat him, and get you away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Jack,&#8221; said the little woman; &#8220;that would
be of no use. The only thing you could do
would be to buy me; for my cruel master has
said that if ever I am late again he shall sell me
in the slave market to the brown people, who
work underground. And, though I am dreadfully
afraid of my master, I mean to be late to-day, in
hopes (as you are kind, and as you have some
money) that you will come to the slave-market
and buy me. Can you buy me, Jack, to be
your slave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want a slave,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;and, besides,
I have hardly any money to buy you
with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is real money,&#8221; said the fairy woman,
&#8220;not like what my master has. His money has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
to be made every week, for if there comes a
hot day it cracks, so it never has time to look
old, as your half-crown does; and that is how
we know the real money, for we cannot imitate
anything that is old. Oh, now, now it is twelve
o&#8217;clock! now I am late again! and though I
said I would do it, I am so frightened!&#8221;</p>
<p>So saying, the little woman ran off towards
the town, wringing her hands, and Jack ran
beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;How am I to find your master?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Jack, buy me! buy me!&#8221; cried the fairy
woman. &#8220;You will find me in the slave-market.
Bid high for me. Go back and put your boots
on, and bid high.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Jack had nothing on his feet, so he left
the poor little woman to run into the town by
herself, and went back to put his boots on. They
were very uncomfortable, as he had no stockings;
but he did not much mind that, and he counted
his money. There was the half-crown that his
grandmamma had given him on his birthday,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
there was a shilling, a sixpence, and two pence,
besides a silver fourpenny-piece which he had
forgotten. He then marched into the town; and
now it was quite full of people,&mdash;all of them
little men and women about his own height.
They thought he was somebody of consequence,
and they called out to him to buy their goods.
And he bought some stockings, and said, &#8220;What
I want to buy now is a slave.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they showed him the way to the slave-market,
and there whole rows of odd-looking
little people were sitting, while in front of them
stood the slaves.</p>
<p>Now Jack had observed as he came along how
very disrespectful the dogs of that town were to
the people. They had a habit of going up to
them and smelling at their legs, and even gnawing
their feet as they sat before the little tables selling
their wares; and what made this more surprising
was that the people did not always seem to find
out when they were being gnawed. But the
moment the dogs saw Jack they came and fawned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
on him, and two old hounds followed him all the
way to the slave-market; and when he took a
seat one of them laid down at his feet, and said,
&#8220;Master, set your handsome feet on my back,
that they may be out of the dust.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid of him,&#8221; said the other
hound; &#8220;he won&#8217;t gnaw your feet. He knows
well enough that they are real ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are the other people&#8217;s feet not real?&#8221; asked
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said the hound. &#8220;They had
a feud long ago with the fairies, and they all
went one night into a great corn-field which belonged
to these enemies of theirs, intending to
steal the corn. So they made themselves invisible,
as they are always obliged to do till twelve
o&#8217;clock at noon; but before morning dawn, the
wheat being quite ripe, down came the fairies
with their sickles, surrounded the field, and cut
the corn. So all their legs of course got cut
off with it, for when they are invisible they cannot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
stir. Ever since that they have been obliged
to make their legs of wood.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the hound was telling this story Jack
looked about, but he did not see one slave who
was in the least like his poor little friend, and
he was beginning to be afraid that he should
not find her, when he heard two people talking
together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-day!&#8221; said one. &#8220;So you have sold
that good-for-nothing slave of yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered a very cross-looking old
man. &#8220;She was late again this morning, and
came to me crying and praying to be forgiven;
but I was determined to make an example of
her, so I sold her at once to Clink-of-the-Hole, and
he has just driven her away to work in his mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack, on hearing this, whispered to the hound
at his feet, &#8220;If you will guide me to Clink&#8217;s hole,
you shall be my dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Master, I will do my best,&#8221; answered the
hound; and he stole softly out of the market, Jack

</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> old hound went straight through the
town, smelling Clink&#8217;s footsteps, till he came
into a large field of barley; and there, sitting
against a sheaf, for it was harvest time, they
found Clink-of-the-Hole. He was a very ugly
little brown man, and he was smoking a pipe in
the shade; while crouched near him was the poor
little woman, with her hands spread before her
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-day, sir,&#8221; said Clink to Jack. &#8220;You
are a stranger here, no doubt?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;I only arrived this
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen the town?&#8221; asked Clink, civilly;
&#8220;there is a very fine market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have seen the market,&#8221; answered Jack.
&#8220;I went into it to buy a slave, but I did not see
one that I liked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Clink; &#8220;and yet they had some
very fine articles.&#8221; Here he pointed to the poor
little woman, and said, &#8220;Now that&#8217;s a useful body
enough, and I had her very cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you give for her?&#8221; said Jack, sitting
down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three pitchers,&#8221; said Clink, &#8220;and fifteen cups
and saucers, and two shillings in the money of the
town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is their money like this?&#8221; said Jack, taking
out his shilling.</p>
<p>When Clink saw the shilling he changed color,
and said, very earnestly, &#8220;Where did you get that,
dear sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it was given me,&#8221; said Jack, carelessly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>Clink looked hard at the shilling, and so did the
fairy woman, and Jack let them look some time,
for he amused himself with throwing it up several
times and catching it. At last he put it back
in his pocket, and then Clink heaved a deep sigh.
Then Jack took out a penny, and began to toss
that up, upon which, to his great surprise, the
little brown man fell on his knees, and said, &#8220;Oh,
a shilling and a penny,&mdash;a shilling and a penny
of mortal coin! What would I not give for a
shilling and a penny!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you have got anything to give,&#8221;
said Jack, cunningly; &#8220;I see nothing but that
ring on your finger, and the old woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have a great many things at home, sir,&#8221;
said the brown man, wiping his eyes; &#8220;and
besides, that ring would be cheap at a shilling,&mdash;even
a shilling of mortal coin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would the slave be cheap at a penny?&#8221; said
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you give a penny for her, dear sir?&#8221;
inquired Clink, trembling with eagerness.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She is honest,&#8221; answered Jack; &#8220;ask her
whether I had better buy her with this penny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does not matter what she says,&#8221; replied the
brown man; &#8220;I would sell twenty such as she is
for a penny,&mdash;a real one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask her,&#8221; repeated Jack; and the poor little
woman wept bitterly, but she said, &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Jack; but she only hung
down her head and cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make you suffer for this,&#8221; said the brown
man. But when Jack took out the shilling, and
said, &#8220;Shall I buy you with this, slave?&#8221; his eyes
actually shot out sparks, he was so eager.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak!&#8221; he said to the fairy woman; &#8220;and if
you don&#8217;t say &#8216;Yes,&#8217; I&#8217;ll strike you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He cannot buy me with that,&#8221; answered the
fairy woman, &#8220;unless it is the most valuable coin
he has got.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brown man, on hearing this, rose up in a
rage, and was just going to strike her a terrible
blow, when Jack cried out, &#8220;Stop!&#8221; and took out
his half-crown.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Can I buy you with this?&#8221; said he; and the
fairy woman answered, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon this Clink drew a long breath, and his
eyes grew bigger and bigger as he gazed at the
half-crown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall she be my slave forever, and not yours,&#8221;
said Jack, &#8220;if I give you this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She shall,&#8221; said the brown man. And he
made such a low bow, as he took the money, that
his head actually knocked the ground. Then he
jumped up; and, as if he was afraid Jack should
repent of his bargain, he ran off towards the hole
in the hill with all his might, shouting for joy as
he went.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slave,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;that is a very ragged old
apron that you have got, and your gown is quite
worn out. Don&#8217;t you think we had better spend
my shilling in buying you some new clothes? You
look so very shabby.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I?&#8221; said the fairy woman, gently. &#8220;Well,
master, you will do as you please.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But you know better than I do,&#8221; said Jack,
&#8220;though you are my slave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better give me the shilling, then,&#8221;
answered the little old woman; &#8220;and then I advise
you to go back to the boat, and wait there till I
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;can you go all the way
back into the town again? I think you must be
tired, for you know you are so very old.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fairy woman laughed when Jack said this,
and she had such a sweet laugh that he loved to
hear it; but she took the shilling, and trudged off
to the town, and he went back to the boat, his
hound running after him.</p>
<p>He was a long time going, for he ran a good
many times after butterflies, and then he climbed
up several trees; and altogether he amused himself
for such a long while that when he reached
the boat his fairy woman was there before him.
So he stepped on board, the hound followed,
and the boat immediately began to swim on.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why, you have not bought any new clothes!&#8221;
said Jack to his slave.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, master,&#8221; answered the fairy woman;
&#8220;but I have bought what I wanted.&#8221; And she
took out of her pocket a little tiny piece of purple
ribbon, with a gold-colored satin edge, and a very
small tortoise-shell comb.</p>
<p>When Jack saw these he was vexed, and said,
&#8220;What do you mean by being so silly? I can&#8217;t
scold you properly, because I don&#8217;t know what
name to call you by, and I don&#8217;t like to say
&#8216;Slave,&#8217; because that sounds so rude. Why, this
bit of ribbon is such a little bit that it&#8217;s of no
use at all. It&#8217;s not large enough even to make one
mitten of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said the slave. &#8220;Just take hold
of it, master, and let us see if it will stretch.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Jack did. And she pulled, and he pulled,
and very soon the silk had stretched till it was
nearly as large as a handkerchief; and then she
shook it, and they pulled again. &#8220;This is very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
good fun,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;why now it is as large
as an apron.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she shook it again, and gave it a twitch
here and a pat there; and then they pulled again,
and the silk suddenly stretched so wide that Jack
was very nearly falling overboard. So Jack&#8217;s
slave pulled off her ragged gown and apron, and
put it on. It was a most beautiful robe of purple
silk; it had a gold border, and it just fitted
her.</p>

JACK&#8217;S SLAVE.<br />
<br />
&#8220;These are fairies,&#8221; said Jack&#8217;s slave; &#8220;but what are you?&#8221;&mdash;<span class='smcap'><a href='#page_99'>Page 99</a>.</span><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; she said. And then she took
out the little tortoise-shell comb, pulled off her
cap, and threw it into the river. She had a
little knot of soft, gray hair, and she let it down,
and began to comb. And as she combed the hair
got much longer and thicker, till it fell in waves
all about her throat. Then she combed again,
and it all turned gold-color, and came tumbling
down to her waist; and then she stood up in the
boat, and combed once more, and shook out the
hair, and there was such a quantity that it reached
down to her feet, and she was so covered with it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
that you could not see one bit of her, excepting
her eyes, which peeped out, and looked bright and
full of tears.</p>
<p>Then she began to gather up her lovely locks;
and when she had dried her eyes with them, she
said, &#8220;Master, do you know what you have
done? look at me now!&#8221; So she threw back
the hair from her face, and it was a beautiful
young face; and she looked so happy that Jack
was glad he had bought her with his half-crown,&mdash;so
glad that he could not help crying, and
the fair slave cried too; and then instantly the
little fairies woke, and sprang out of Jack&#8217;s
pockets. As they did so, Jovinian cried out,
&#8220;Madam, I am your most humble servant&#8221;; and
Roxaletta said, &#8220;I hope your Grace is well&#8221;;
but the third got on Jack&#8217;s knee, and took hold
of the buttons of his waistcoat, and when the
lovely slave looked at her, she hid her face and
blushed with pretty childish shyness.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are fairies,&#8221; said Jack&#8217;s slave; &#8220;but
what are you?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Jack kissed me,&#8221; said the little thing; &#8220;and
I want to sit on his knee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;I took them out, and laid
them in a row, to see that they were safe, and
this one I kissed, because she looked such a little
dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was she not like the others, then?&#8221; asked
the slave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;but I liked her the best;
she was my favorite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the instant these three fairies sprang out
of Jack&#8217;s pockets, they got very much larger; in
fact, they became fully grown,&mdash;that is to say,
they measured exactly one foot one inch in height,
which, as most people know, is exactly the proper
height for fairies of that tribe. The two who
had sprung out first were very beautifully dressed.
One had a green velvet coat, and a sword, the
hilt of which was incrusted with diamonds. The
second had a white spangled robe, and the loveliest
rubies and emeralds round her neck and in
her hair; but the third, the one who sat on Jack&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
knee, had a white frock and a blue sash on. She
had soft, fat arms, and a face just like that of a
sweet little child.</p>
<p>When Jack&#8217;s slave saw this, she took the little
creature on her knee, and said to her, &#8220;How
comes it that you are not like your companions?&#8221;</p>
<p>And she answered, in a pretty lisping voice,
&#8220;It&#8217;s because Jack kissed me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even so it must be,&#8221; answered the slave;
&#8220;the love of a mortal works changes indeed. It
is not often that we win anything so precious.
Here, master, let her sit on your knee sometimes,
and take care of her, for she cannot now take
the same care of herself that others of her race
are capable of.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Jack let little Mopsa sit on his knee; and
when he was tired of admiring his slave, and
wondering at the respect with which the other
two fairies treated her, and at their cleverness in
getting water-lilies for her, and fanning her with
feathers, he curled himself up in the bottom of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
the boat with his own little favorite, and taught
her how to play at cat&#8217;s-cradle.</p>
<p>When they had been playing some time, and
Mopsa was getting quite clever at the game, the
lovely slave said, &#8220;Master, it is a long time since
you spoke to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;there is something
that I particularly want to ask you about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask it then,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to have a slave,&#8221; answered Jack;
&#8220;and as you are so clever, don&#8217;t you think you
can find out how to be free again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad you asked me about that,&#8221;
said the fairy woman. &#8220;Yes, master, I wish very
much to be free; and as you were so kind as to
give the most valuable piece of real money you
possessed in order to buy me, I can be free if
you can think of anything that you really like
better than that half-crown, and if I can give it
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there are many things,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
like going up this river to Fairyland much better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are going there, master,&#8221; said the
fairy woman; &#8220;you were on the way before I
met with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like this little child better,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;I
love this little Mopsa. I should like her to
belong to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is yours,&#8221; answered the fairy woman;
&#8220;she belongs to you already. Think of something
else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack thought again, and was so long about it
that at last the beautiful slave said to him,
&#8220;Master, do you see those purple mountains?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack turned round in the boat, and saw a
splendid range of purple mountains, going up
and up. They were very great and steep, each
had a crown of snow, and the sky was very red
behind them, for the sun was going down.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the other side of those mountains is
Fairyland,&#8221; said the slave; &#8220;but if you cannot
think of something that you should like better to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
have than your half-crown, I can never enter in.
The river flows straight up to yonder steep precipice,
and there is a chasm in it which pierces
it, and through which the river runs down beneath,
among the very roots of the mountains,
till it comes out at the other side. Thousands
and thousands of the small people will come
when they see the boat, each with a silken thread
in his hand; but if there is a slave in it, not
all their strength and skill can tow it through.
Look at those rafts on the river; on them are
the small people coming up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack looked, and saw that the river was
spotted with rafts, on which were crowded brown
fairy sailors, each one with three green stripes
on his sleeve, which looked like good conduct
marks. All these sailors were chattering very
fast, and the rafts were coming down to meet
the boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;All these sailors to tow my slave!&#8221; said Jack.
&#8220;I wonder, I do wonder, what you are?&#8221; But
the fairy woman only smiled, and Jack went on:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
&#8220;I have thought of something that I should like
much better than my half-crown. I should like
to have a little tiny bit of that purple gown of
yours with the gold border.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the fairy woman said, &#8220;I thank you,
master. Now I can be free.&#8221; So she told Jack
to lend her his knife, and with it she cut off a
very small piece of the skirt of her robe, and
gave it to him. &#8220;Now mind,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I advise
you never to stretch this unless you want
to make some particular thing of it, for then
it will only stretch to the right size; but if you
merely begin to pull it for your own amusement,
it will go on stretching and stretching, and I don&#8217;t
know where it will stop.&#8221;</p>

<p class='indent2'>Rose the years as from a deep;</p>
<p>In the world&#8217;s great heart she found it,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Cradled like a child asleep.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>In the night I saw her weaving</p>
<p class='indent2'>By the misty moonbeam cold,</p>
<p>All the weft her shuttle cleaving</p>
<p class='indent2'>With a sacred thread of gold.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>

</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>By</span> this time, as the sun had gone down, and
none of the moons had risen, it would have
been dark but that each of the rafts was rigged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
with a small mast that had a lantern hung
to it.</p>
<p>By the light of these lanterns Jack saw crowds
of little brown faces; and presently many rafts
had come up to the boat, which was now swimming
very slowly. Every sailor in every raft
fastened to the boat&#8217;s side a silken thread; then
the rafts were rowed to shore, and the sailors
jumped out, and began to tow the boat along.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>These crimson threads looked no stronger than
the silk that ladies sew with, yet by means of
them the small people drew the boat along merrily.
There were so many of them that they
looked like an army as they marched in the light
of the lanterns and torches. Jack thought they
were very happy, though the work was hard, for
they shouted and sang.</p>
<p>The fairy woman looked more beautiful than
ever now, and far more stately. She had on a
band of precious stones to bind back her hair, and
they shone so brightly in the night that her features
could be clearly seen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>Jack&#8217;s little favorite was fast asleep, and the
other two fairies had flown away. He was beginning
to feel rather sleepy himself, when he was
roused by the voice of his free lady, who said to
him, &#8220;Jack, there is no one listening now,
so I will tell you my story. I am the Fairy
Queen!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack opened his eyes very wide, but he was so
much surprised that he did not say a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;One day, long, long ago,&#8221; said the Queen, &#8220;I
was discontented with my own happy country.
I wished to see the world, so I set forth with a
number of the one-foot-one fairies, and went
down the wonderful river, thinking to see the
world.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we sailed down the river till we came to
that town which you know of; and there, in the
very middle of the stream, stood a tower,&mdash;a tall
tower, built upon a rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairies are afraid of nothing but of other
fairies, and we did not think this tower was
fairy-work, so we left our ship and went up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
rock and into the tower, to see what it was like;
but just as we had descended into the dungeon
keep, we heard the gurgling of water overhead,
and down came the tower. It was nothing but
water enchanted into the likeness of stone, and
we all fell down with it into the very bed of the
river.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we were not drowned, but there
we were obliged to lie, for we have no power
out of our own element; and the next day the
towns-people came down with a net and dragged
the river, picked us all out of the meshes, and
made us slaves. The one-foot-one fairies got away
shortly; but from that day to this, in sorrow and
distress, I have had to serve my masters. Luckily,
my crown had fallen off in the water, so I was
not known to be the Queen; but till you came,
Jack, I had almost forgotten that I had ever been
happy and free, and I had hardly any hope of
getting away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How sorry your people must have been,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
said Jack, &#8220;when they found you did not come
home again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the Queen: &#8220;they only went to
sleep, and they will not wake till to-morrow morning,
when I pass in again. They will think I
have been absent for a day, and so will the apple-woman.
You must not undeceive them; if you
do, they will be very angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who is the apple-woman?&#8221; inquired
Jack; but the Queen blushed, and pretended
not to hear the question, so he repeated,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Queen, who is the apple-woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only had her for a very little while,&#8221; said
the Queen, evasively.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how long do you think you have been a
slave. Queen?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said the Queen. &#8220;I have
never been able to make up my mind about
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now all the moons began to shine, and
all the trees lighted themselves up, for almost
every leaf had a glowworm or a fire-fly on it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
and the water was full of fishes that had shining
eyes. And now they were close to the steep
mountain side; and Jack looked and saw an
opening in it, into which the river ran. It was
a kind of cave, something like a long, long church
with a vaulted roof, only the pavement of it was
that magic river, and a narrow towing-path ran
on either side.</p>
<p>As they entered the cave there was a hollow,
murmuring sound, and the Queen&#8217;s crown became
so bright that it lighted up the whole boat; at
the same time she began to tell Jack a wonderful
story, which he liked very much to hear, but
every fresh thing she said he forgot what had gone
before; and at last, though he tried very hard to
listen, he was obliged to go to sleep; and he slept
soundly, and never dreamed of anything, till it
was morning.</p>
<p>He saw such a curious sight when he woke!
They had been going through this underground
cavern all night, and now they were approaching
its opening on the other side. This opening,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
because they were a good way from it yet, looked
like a lovely little round window of blue and
yellow and green glass, but as they drew on he
could see far-off mountains, blue sky, and a country
all covered with sunshine.</p>
<p>He heard singing, too, such as fairies make;
and he saw some beautiful people, such as those
fairies whom he had brought with him. They
were coming along the towing-path. They were
all lady fairies; but they were not very polite,
for as each one came up she took a silken rope
out of a brown sailor&#8217;s hand, and gave him a
shove which pushed him into the water. In fact,
the water became filled with such swarms of these
sailors that the boat could hardly get on. But the
poor little brown fellows did not seem to mind
this conduct, for they plunged and shook themselves
about, scattering a good deal of spray.
Then they all suddenly dived, and when they
came up again they were ducks,&mdash;nothing but
brown ducks, I assure you, with green stripes on
their wings; and with a great deal of quacking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
and floundering, they all began to swim back
again as fast as they could.</p>
<p>Then Jack was a good deal vexed, and he said
to himself, &#8220;If nobody thanks the ducks for towing
us I will&#8221;; so he stood up in the boat and
shouted, &#8220;Thank you, ducks; we are very much
obliged to you!&#8221; But neither the Queen nor
these new towers took the least notice, and gradually
the boat came out of that dim cave and
entered Fairyland, while the river became so
narrow that you could hear the song of the
towers quite easily; those on the right bank
sang the first verse, and those on the left bank
answered:&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>

</div></div>
<p>&#8220;Master,&#8221; whispered the old hound, who was
lying at Jack&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t invent that song themselves,&#8221;
said the hound; &#8220;the old apple-woman taught
it to them,&mdash;the woman whom they love because
she can make them cry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack was rather ashamed of the hound&#8217;s rudeness
in saying this; but the Queen took no notice.
And now they had reached a little landing-place,
which ran out a few feet into the river, and
was strewed thickly with cowslips and violets.</p>

<p>Here the boat stopped, and the Queen rose
and got out.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>Jack watched her. A whole crowd of one-foot-one
fairies came down a garden to meet her,
and he saw them conduct her to a beautiful tent,
with golden poles and a silken covering; but
nobody took the slightest notice of him, or of
little Mopsa, or of the hound, and after a long
silence the hound said, &#8220;Well, master, don&#8217;t you
feel hungry? Why don&#8217;t you go with the others
and have some breakfast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Queen didn&#8217;t invite me,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;But do you feel as if you couldn&#8217;t go?&#8221;
asked the hound.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; answered Jack; &#8220;but perhaps
I may not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, master,&#8221; replied the hound; &#8220;whatever
you <i>can</i> do in Fairyland you <i>may</i> do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure of that?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite sure, master,&#8221; said the hound; &#8220;and
I am hungry too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;I will go there and take
Mopsa. She shall ride on my shoulder; you may
follow.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>So he walked up that beautiful garden till he
came to the great tent. A banquet was going on
inside. All the one-foot-one fairies sat down the
sides of the table, and at the top sat the Queen
on a larger chair; and there were two empty
chairs, one on each side of her.</p>
<p>Jack blushed; but the hound whispering again,
&#8220;Master, whatever you can do you may do,&#8221; he
came slowly up the table towards the Queen, who
was saying, as he drew near, &#8220;Where is our
trusty and well-beloved, the apple-woman?&#8221; And
she took no notice of Jack; so, though he could
not help feeling rather red and ashamed, he went
and sat in the chair beside her with Mopsa still
on his shoulder. Mopsa laughed for joy when
she saw the feast. The Queen said, &#8220;O Jack, I
am so glad to see you!&#8221; and some of the one-foot-one
fairies cried out, &#8220;What a delightful
little creature that is! She can laugh! Perhaps
she can also cry!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack looked about, but there was no seat for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
Mopsa; and he was afraid to let her run about
on the floor, lest she should be hurt.</p>
<p>There was a very large dish standing before
the Queen; for though the people were small,
the plates and dishes were exactly like those we
use, and of the same size.</p>
<p>This dish was raised on a foot, and filled with
grapes and peaches. Jack wondered at himself
for doing it, but he saw no other place for
Mopsa; so he took out the fruit, laid it round
the dish, and set his own little one-foot-one in
the dish.</p>
<p>Nobody looked in the least surprised; and
there she sat very happily, biting an apple with
her small white teeth.</p>
<p>Then, as they brought him nothing to eat, Jack
helped himself from some of the dishes before
him, and found that a fairy breakfast was very
nice indeed.</p>
<p>In the meantime there was a noise outside, and
in stumped an elderly woman. She had very
thick boots on, a short gown of red print, an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
orange cotton handkerchief over her shoulders,
and a black silk bonnet. She was exactly the
same height as the Queen,&mdash;for of course nobody
in Fairyland is allowed to be any bigger
than the Queen; so, if they are not children
when they arrive, they are obliged to shrink.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, dear?&#8221; said the Queen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am as well as can be expected,&#8221; answered
the apple-woman, sitting down in the empty
chair. &#8220;Now, then, where&#8217;s my tea? They&#8217;re
never ready with my cup of tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two attendants immediately brought a cup of
tea, and set it down before the apple-woman,
with a plate of bread and butter; and she proceeded
to pour it into the saucer, and blow it,
because it was hot. In so doing her wandering
eyes caught sight of Jack and little Mopsa, and
she set down the saucer, and looked at them
with attention.</p>
<p>Now Mopsa, I am sorry to say, was behaving
so badly that Jack was quite ashamed of her.
First, she got out of her dish, took something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
nice out of the Queen&#8217;s plate with her fingers,
and ate it; and then, as she was going back,
she tumbled over a melon, and upset a glass of
red wine, which she wiped up with her white
frock; after which she got into her dish again,
and there she sat smiling, and daubing her pretty
face with a piece of buttered muffin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mopsa,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;you are very naughty;
if you behave in this way, I shall never take
you out to parties again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty lamb!&#8221; said the apple-woman; &#8220;It&#8217;s
just like a child.&#8221; And then she burst into
tears, and exclaimed, sobbing, &#8220;It&#8217;s many a long
day since I&#8217;ve seen a child. Oh dear! oh deary
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon this, to the astonishment of Jack, every
one of the guests began to cry and sob too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear! oh dear!&#8221; they said to one another,
&#8220;we&#8217;re crying; we can cry just as well as men
and women. Isn&#8217;t it delightful? What a luxury
it is to cry, to be sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>They were evidently quite proud of it; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
when Jack looked at the Queen for an explanation,
she only gave him a still little smile.</p>
<p>But Mopsa crept along the table to the apple-woman,
let her take her and hug her, and seemed
to like her very much; for as she sat on her
knee, she patted her brown face with a little
dimpled hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like vastly well to be her nurse,&#8221;
said the apple-woman, drying her eyes, and
looking at Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll always wash her, and put clean
frocks on her, you may,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;for just
look at her,&mdash;what a figure she is already!&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon this the apple-woman laughed for joy,
and again every one else did the same. The
fairies can only laugh and cry when they see
mortals do so.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br /><br />AFTER THE PARTY.</h2>
</div>
<div class='poem' style='width: 25em'><div class='stanza'>
<p><i>Stephano.</i>&mdash;This will prove a brave kingdom to me,</p>
<p class='indent12'>Where I shall have my music for nothing.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='ralign'><i>The Tempest.</i></p>
</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>When</span> breakfast was over, the guests got up,
one after the other, without taking the
least notice of the Queen; and the tent began to
get so thin and transparent that you could see
the trees and the sky through it. At last, it
looked only like a colored mist, with blue, and
green, and yellow stripes, and then it was gone;
and the table and all the things on it began to
go in the same way. Only Jack, and the apple-woman,
and Mopsa were left, sitting on their
chairs, with the Queen between them.</p>
<p>Presently, the Queen&#8217;s lips began to move,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
and her eyes looked straight before her, as she
sat upright in her chair. Whereupon the apple-woman
snatched up Mopsa, and, seizing Jack&#8217;s
hand, hurried him off, exclaiming, &#8220;Come away!
come away! She is going to tell one of her
stories; and if you listen, you&#8217;ll be obliged to
go to sleep, and sleep nobody knows how long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack did not want to go to sleep; he wished
to go down to the river again, and see what had
become of his boat, for he had left his cap and
several other things in it.</p>
<p>So he parted from the apple-woman,&mdash;who
took Mopsa with her, and said he would find
her again when he wanted her at her apple-stall,&mdash;and
went down to the boat, where he
saw that his faithful hound was there before
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was lucky, master, that I came when I
did,&#8221; said the hound, &#8220;for a dozen or so of those
one-foot-one fellows were just shoving it off, and
you will want it at night to sleep in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;and I can stretch the bit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
of purple silk to make a canopy over head,&mdash;a
sort of awning,&mdash;for I should not like to sleep
in tents or palaces that are inclined to melt
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the hound with his teeth, and Jack with
his hands, pulled and pulled at the silk till it
was large enough to make a splendid canopy,
like a tent; and it reached down to the water&#8217;s
edge, and roofed in all the after part of the
boat.</p>
<p>So now he had a delightful little home of his
own; and there was no fear of its being blown
away, for no wind ever blows in Fairyland. All
the trees are quite still, no leaf rustles, and the
flowers lie on the ground exactly where they
fall.</p>
<p>After this Jack told the hound to watch his
boat, and went himself in search of the apple-woman.
Not one fairy was to be seen, any more
than if he had been in his own country, and he
wandered down the green margin of the river
till he saw the apple-woman sitting at a small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
stall with apples on it, and cherries tied to sticks,
and some dry-looking nuts. She had Mopsa on
her knee, and had washed her face, and put a
beautiful clean white frock on her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are all the fairies gone to?&#8221; asked
Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never take any notice of that common trash
and their doings,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;When the
Queen takes to telling her stories they are generally
frightened, and go and sit in the tops of the
trees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you seem very fond of Mopsa,&#8221; said
Jack, &#8220;and she is one of them. You will help
me to take care of her, won&#8217;t you, tills she grows
a little older?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grows!&#8221; said the apple-woman, laughing.
&#8220;Grows! Why you don&#8217;t think, surely, that she
will ever be any different from what she is
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought she would grow up,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;They never change so long as they last,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
answered the apple-woman, &#8220;when once they are
one-foot-one high.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mopsa,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;come here, and I&#8217;ll
measure you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mopsa came dancing towards Jack, and he
tried to measure her, first with a yard measure
that the apple-woman took out of her pocket,
and then with a stick, and then with a bit of
string; but Mopsa would not stand steady, and
at last it ended in their having a good game of
romps together, and a race; but when he carried
her back, sitting on his shoulder, he was sorry
to see that the apple-woman was crying again,
and he asked her kindly what she did it for.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is because,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I shall never
see my own country any more, nor any men and
women and children, excepting such as by a rare
chance stray in for a little while as you have done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can go back whenever I please,&#8221; said Jack.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I came in of my own good-will,
after I had had fair warning that if I came at all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
it would end in my staying always. Besides, I
don&#8217;t know that I exactly wish to go home again:
I should be afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid of what?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, there&#8217;s the rain and the cold, and not
having anything to eat excepting what you earn.
And yet,&#8221; said the apple-woman, &#8220;I have three
boys of my own at home; one of them must be
nearly a man by this time, and the youngest is
about as old as you are. If I went home I might
find one or more of those boys in jail, and then
how miserable I should be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are not happy as it is,&#8221; said Jack.
&#8220;I have seen you cry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the apple-woman; &#8220;but now I
live here I don&#8217;t care about anything so much
as I used to do. &#8216;May I have a satin gown
and a coach?&#8217; I asked, when first I came. &#8216;You
may have a hundred and fifty satin gowns if you
like,&#8217; said the Queen, &#8216;and twenty coaches with
six cream-colored horses to each.&#8217; But when I
had been here a little time, and found I could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
have everything I wished for, and change it as
often as I pleased, I began not to care for anything;
and at last I got so sick of all their
grand things that I dressed myself in my own
clothes that I came in, and made up my mind
to have a stall and sit at it, as I used to do,
selling apples. And I used to say to myself, &#8216;I
have but to wish with all my heart to go home,
and I can go, I know that;&#8217; but oh dear! oh
dear! I couldn&#8217;t wish enough, for it would come
into my head that I should be poor, or that my
boys would have forgotten me, or that my neighbors
would look down on me, and so I always
put off wishing for another day. Now here is
the Queen coming. Sit down on the grass and
play with Mopsa. Don&#8217;t let her see us talking
together, lest she should think I have been telling
you things which you ought not to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack looked, and saw the Queen coming slowly
towards them, with her hands held out before
her, as if it was dark. She felt her way, yet her
eyes were wide open, and she was telling her
stories all the time.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you listen to a word she says,&#8221; whispered
the apple-woman; and then, in order that
Jack might not hear what the Queen was talking
about, she began to sing.</p>
<p>She had no sooner begun than up from the
river came swarms of one-foot-one fairies to listen,
and hundreds of them dropped down from the
trees. The Queen, too, seemed to attend as they
did, though she kept murmuring her story all the
time; and nothing that any of them did appeared
to surprise the apple-woman,&mdash;she sang as if
nobody was taking any notice at all:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>
<p>As the apple-woman left off singing, the Queen
moved away, still murmuring the words of her
story, and Jack said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does the Queen tell stories of what has happened,
or of what is going to happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of what is going to happen, of course,&#8221;
replied the woman. &#8220;Anybody could tell the
other sort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I heard a little of it,&#8221; observed Jack.
&#8220;I thought she was talking of me. She said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
&#8216;So he took the measure, and Mopsa stood still
for once, and he found she was only one foot
high, and she grew a great deal after that. Yes,
she can grow.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fine hearing, and a strange hearing,&#8221;
said the apple-woman; &#8220;and what did she mutter
next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of how she heard me sobbing,&#8221; replied Jack;
&#8220;and while you went on about stepping on
board the ship, she said, &#8216;He was very good to
me, dear little fellow! But Fate is the name
of my old mother, and she reigns here. Oh, she
reigns! The fatal F is in her name, and I cannot
take it out!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; replied the apple-woman, &#8220;they all say
that, and that they are fays, and that mortals
call their history fable; they are always crying
out for an alphabet without the fatal F.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then she told how she heard Mopsa
sobbing too,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;sobbing among the
reeds and rushes by the river side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no reeds, and no rushes either,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
here,&#8221; said the apple-woman, &#8220;and I have walked
the river from end to end. I don&#8217;t think much
of that part of the story. But you are sure
she said that Mopsa was short of her proper
height?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and that she would grow; but that&#8217;s
nothing. In my country we always grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue about you country!&#8221; said
the apple-woman, sharply. &#8220;Do you want to
make enemies of them all?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mopsa had been listening to this, and now she
said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t love the Queen. She slapped my
arm as she went by, and it hurts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mopsa showed her little fat arm as she spoke,
and there was a red place on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s odd, too,&#8221; said the apple-woman;
&#8220;there&#8217;s nothing red in a common fairy&#8217;s veins.
They have sap in them: that&#8217;s why they can&#8217;t
blush.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then the sun went down, and Mopsa got
up on the apple-woman&#8217;s lap, and went to sleep;
and Jack, being tired, went to his boat and lay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
down under the purple canopy, his old hound
lying at his feet to keep guard over him.</p>
<p>The next morning, when he woke, a pretty
voice called to him, &#8220;Jack! Jack!&#8221; and he
opened his eyes and saw Mopsa. The apple-woman
had dressed her in a clean frock and blue
shoes, and her hair was so long! She was standing
on the landing-place, close to him. &#8220;O Jack!
I&#8217;m so big,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I grew in the night;
look at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack looked. Yes, Mopsa had grown indeed;
she had only just reached to his knee the day
before, and now her little bright head, when he
measured her, came as high as the second button
of his waistcoat.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I hope you will not go on growing so
fast as this,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;or you will be as tall as
my mamma is in a week or two,&mdash;much too big
for me to play with.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br /><br />MOPSA LEARNS HER LETTERS.</h2>
</div>
<div class='poem' style='width: 10em'><div class='stanza'>
<p>A&mdash;&mdash;apple-pie.</p>
<p>B&mdash;&mdash;bit it.</p>
</div></div>
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class='drop'>H</span><span class='dcap'>ow</span> ashamed I am,&#8221; Jack said, &#8220;to think
that you don&#8217;t know even your letters!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mopsa replied that she thought that did not
signify, and then she and Jack began to play at
jumping from the boat on to the bank, and back
again; and afterwards, as not a single fairy could
be seen, they had breakfast with the apple-woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the Queen?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>The apple-woman answered, &#8220;It&#8217;s not the fashion
to ask questions in Fairyland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a pity,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;for there are several
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
things that I particularly want to know about this
country. Mayn&#8217;t I even ask how big it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How big?&#8221; said Mopsa,&mdash;little Mopsa looking
as wise as possible. &#8220;Why, the same size
as your world, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack laughed. &#8220;It&#8217;s the same world that you
call yours,&#8221; continued Mopsa; &#8220;and when I&#8217;m a
little older, I&#8217;ll explain it all to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s our world,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;why are none
of us in it, excepting me and the apple-woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you&#8217;ve got something in your
world that you call <span class='smcap'>Time</span>,&#8221; said Mopsa; &#8220;so you
talk about <span class='smcaplc'>NOW</span>, and you talk about <span class='smcaplc'>THEN</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do if I want to make you understand,&#8221; said
Mopsa.</p>
<p>The apple-woman laughed, and said, &#8220;To think
of the pretty thing talking so queen-like already!
Yes, that&#8217;s right, and just what the grown-up
fairies say. Go on, and explain it to him if you
can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; said Mopsa, &#8220;that your people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
say there was a time when there were none of
them in the world,&mdash;a time before they were
made. Well, <span class='smcaplc'>THIS</span> is that time. This is long
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Then how do I
happen to be here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Mopsa, &#8220;when the albatross
brought you, she did not fly with you a long
way off, but a long way back,&mdash;hundreds and
hundreds of years. This is your world, as you
can see; but none of your people are here, because
they are not made yet. I don&#8217;t think any
of them will be made for a thousand years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I saw the old ships,&#8221; answered Jack,
&#8220;in the enchanted bay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a border country,&#8221; said Mopsa.
&#8220;I was asleep while you went through those
countries; but these are the real Fairylands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack was very much surprised when he heard
Mopsa say these strange things; and as he looked
at her, he felt that a sleep was coming over
him, and he could not hold up his head. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
felt how delightful it was to go to sleep; and
though the apple-woman sprang to him, when
she observed that he was shutting his eyes, and
though he heard her begging and entreating him
to keep awake, he did not want to do so; but he
let his head sink down on the mossy grass, which
was as soft as a pillow, and there, under the shade
of a Guelder rose-tree, that kept dropping its
white flowerets all over him, he had this dream:</p>
<p>He thought that Mopsa came running up to
him, as he stood by the river, and that he said
to her, &#8220;Oh, Mopsa, how old we are! We
have lived back to the times before Adam and
Eve!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mopsa; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t feel old.
Let us go down the river, and see what we can
find.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they got into the boat, and it floated into
the middle of the river, and then made for the
opposite bank, where the water was warm and
very muddy, and the river became so very wide
that it seemed to be afternoon when they got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
near enough to see it clearly; and what they
saw was a boggy country, green, and full of
little rills; but the water,&mdash;which, as I told you,
was thick and muddy,&mdash;the water was full of
small holes! You never saw water with eyelet-holes
in it; but Jack did. On all sides of the
boat he saw holes moving about in pairs, and
some were so close that he looked and saw their
lining: they were lined with pink, and they
snorted! Jack was afraid, but he considered
that this was such a long time ago that the
holes, whatever they were, could not hurt him;
but it made him start, notwithstanding, when a
huge flat-head reared itself up close to the boat,
and he found that the holes were the nostrils
of creatures who kept all the rest of themselves
under water.</p>
<p>In a minute or two, hundreds of ugly flat-heads
popped up, and the boat danced among them
as they floundered about in the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope they won&#8217;t upset us,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;I
wish you would land.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>Mopsa said she would rather not, because she
did not like the hairy elephants.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no such things as hairy elephants,&#8221;
said Jack, in his dream; but he had hardly
spoken when out of a wood close at hand some
huge creatures, far larger than our elephants,
came jogging down to the water. There were
forty or fifty of them, and they were covered
with what looked like tow. In fact, so coarse
was their shaggy hair that they looked as if
they were dressed in door-mats; and when they
stood still and shook themselves, such clouds of
dust flew out that, as it swept over the river, it
almost stifled Jack and Mopsa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Odious!&#8221; exclaimed Jack, sneezing. &#8220;What
terrible creatures these are!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered Mopsa, at the other end of
the boat (but he could hardly see her for the
dust), &#8220;then why do you dream of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack had just decided to dream of something
else, when, with a noise greater than fifty trumpets,
the elephants, having shaken out all the dust,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
came thundering down to the water to bathe in
the liquid mud. They shook the whole country
as they plunged; but that was not all. The awful
river-horses rose up, and, with shrill screams, fell
upon them, and gave them battle; while up from
every rill peeped above the rushes frogs as large
as oxen, and with blue and green eyes that
gleamed like the eyes of cats.</p>
<p>The frogs croaking, and the shrill trumpeting
of the elephants, together with the cries of the
river-horses, as all these creatures fought with
horn and tusk, and fell on one another, lashing
the water into whirlpools, among which the boat
danced up and down like a cork,&mdash;the blinding
spray, and the flapping about of great bats over
the boat and in it,&mdash;so confused Jack, that Mopsa
had spoken to him several times before he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Jack!&#8221; she said, at last; &#8220;if you can&#8217;t
dream any better, I must call the Craken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;m almost wrapped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
up and smothered in bats&#8217; wings, so call anything
you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon Mopsa whistled softly, and in a
minute or two he saw, almost spanning the river,
a hundred yards off, a thing like a rainbow, or
a slender bridge, or still more, like one ring or
coil of an enormous serpent; and presently the
creature&#8217;s head shot up like a fountain, close
to the boat, almost as high as a ship&#8217;s mast.
It was the Craken; and when Mopsa saw it, she
began to cry, and said, &#8220;We are caught in this
crowd of creatures, and we cannot get away
from the land of dreams. Do help us, Craken!&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the bats that hung to the edges of
the boat had wings as large as sails; and the
first thing the Craken did was to stoop its lithe
neck, pick two or three of them off, and eat them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can swim your boat home under my
coils where the water is calm,&#8221; the Craken said,
&#8220;for she is so extremely old now, that if you do
not take care she will drop to pieces before you
get back to the present time.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>Jack knew it was of no use saying anything
to this formidable creature, before whom the
river-horses and the elephants were rushing to
the shore; but when he looked and saw down
the river rainbow behind rainbow,&mdash;I mean coil
behind coil,&mdash;glittering in the sun, like so many
glorious arches that did not reach to the banks,
he felt extremely glad that this was a dream, and
besides that, he thought to himself, &#8220;It&#8217;s only a
fabled monster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s only a fable to these times,&#8221; said
Mopsa, answering his thought; &#8220;but in spite
of that we shall have to go through all the
rings.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went under one,&mdash;silver, green, and
blue, and gold. The water dripped from it upon
them, and the boat trembled, either because of
its great age, or because it felt the rest of the coil
underneath.</p>
<p>A good way off was another coil, and they
went so safely under that, that Jack felt himself
getting used to Crakens, and not afraid.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
Then they went under thirteen more. These
kept getting nearer and nearer together, but,
besides that, the fourteenth had not quite such
a high span as the former ones; but there were
a great many to come, and yet they got lower
and lower.</p>
<p>Both Jack and Mopsa noticed this, but neither
said a word. The thirtieth coil brushed Jack&#8217;s
cap off, then they had to stoop to pass under
the two next, and then they had to lie down in
the bottom of the boat, and they got through
with the greatest difficulty; but still before them
was another! The boat was driving straight
towards it, and it lay so close to the water that
the arch it made was only a foot high. When
Jack saw it, he called out, &#8220;No! that I cannot
bear. Somebody else may do the rest of this
dream. I shall jump overboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mopsa seemed to answer in quite a pleasant
voice, as if she was not afraid,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;d much better wake.&#8221; And then she
went on, &#8220;Jack! Jack! why don&#8217;t you wake!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>Then all on a sudden Jack opened his eyes,
and found that he was lying quietly on the grass,
that little Mopsa really had asked him why he
did not wake. He saw the Queen too, standing
by, looking at him, and saying to herself, &#8220;<i>I</i> did
not put him to sleep. <i>I</i> did not put him to
sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want any more stories to-day,
Queen,&#8221; said the apple-woman, in a disrespectful
tone, and she immediately began to sing,
clattering some tea-things all the time, for a kettle
was boiling on some sticks, and she was going
to make tea out of doors:&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>

<p class='indent2'>Feathers, and moss, and a wisp of hay:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, my sweet singer, thy days are told</p>
<p class='indent2'>(Feathers and moss, and a wisp of hay)!</p>
<p>Thine eyes are dim, and the eggs grow cold.</p>
<p class='indent2'>O mournful morrow! O dark to-day!&#8221;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>The finch flew back to her cold, cold nest,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Feathers and moss, and a wisp of hay,</p>
<p>Mine is the trouble that rent her breast,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And home is silent, and love is clay.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Jack felt very tired indeed,&mdash;as much tired
as if he had really been out all day on the river,
and gliding under the coils of the Craken. He
however rose up, when the apple-woman called
him, and drank his tea, and had some fairy bread
with it, which refreshed him very much.</p>
<p>After tea he measured Mopsa again, and found
that she had grown up to a higher button. She
looked much wiser too, and when he said she
must be taught to read she made no objection,
so he arranged daisies and buttercups into the
forms of the letters, and she learnt nearly all
of them that one evening, while crowds of the
one-foot-one fairies looked on, hanging from the
boughs and sitting in the grass, and shouting out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
the names of the letters as Mopsa said them.
They were very polite to Jack, for they gathered
all these flowers for him, and emptied them
from their little caps at his feet as fast as he
wanted them.</p>

</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Jack</span> crept under his canopy, went to sleep
early that night, and did not wake till the
sun had risen, when the apple-woman called
him, and said breakfast was nearly ready.</p>
<p>The same thing never happens twice in Fairyland,
so this time the breakfast was not spread
in a tent, but on the river. The Queen had
cut off a tiny piece of her robe, the one-foot-one
fairies had stretched it till it was very large, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
then they had spread it on the water, where it
floated and lay like a great carpet of purple and
gold. One corner of it was moored to the side
of Jack&#8217;s boat; but he had not observed this,
because of his canopy. However, that was now
looped up by the apple-woman, and Jack and
Mopsa saw what was going on.</p>
<p>Hundreds of swans had been towing the carpet
along, and were still holding it with their beaks,
while a crowd of doves walked about on it,
smoothing out the creases and patting it with
their pretty pink feet till it was quite firm and
straight. The swans then swam away, and they
flew away.</p>
<p>Presently troops of fairies came down to the
landing-place, jumped into Jack&#8217;s boat without
asking leave, and so got on to the carpet, while
at the same time a great tree which grew on the
bank began to push out fresh leaves, as large as
fans, and shoot out long branches, which again
shot out others, till very soon there was shade
all over the carpet,&mdash;a thick shadow as good as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
a tent, which was very pleasant, for the sun
was already hot.</p>
<p>When the Queen came down, the tree suddenly
blossomed out with thousands of red and
white flowers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not go on to that carpet,&#8221; said
the apple-woman; &#8220;let us sit still in the boat,
and be served here.&#8221; She whispered this as the
Queen stepped into the boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Jack,&#8221; said the Queen.
&#8220;Good-morning, dear.&#8221; This was to the apple-woman;
and then she stood still for a moment
and looked earnestly at little Mopsa, and sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said to her, &#8220;don&#8217;t you mean to
speak to me?&#8221; Then Mopsa lifted up her pretty
face and blushed very rosy red, and said, in a
shy voice, &#8220;Good morning&mdash;&mdash;sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said so!&#8221; exclaimed the Queen; &#8220;I said
so!&#8221; and she lifted up her beautiful eyes, and
murmured out, &#8220;What is to be done now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Queen dear,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;If it
was rude of Mopsa to say that, she is such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
little young thing that she does not know
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not rude,&#8221; said Mopsa, and she laughed
and blushed again. &#8220;It was not rude, and I am
not sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she said this the Queen stepped on to the
carpet, and all the flowers began to drop down.
They were something like camellias, and there
were thousands of them.</p>
<p>The fairies collected them in little heaps. They
had no tables and chairs, nor any plates and dishes
for this breakfast; but the Queen sat down on
the carpet close to Jack&#8217;s boat, and leaned her
cheek on her hand, and seemed to be lost in
thought. The fairies put some flowers into her
lap, then each took some, and they all sat down
and looked at the Queen, but she did not stir.</p>
<p>At last Jack said, &#8220;When is the breakfast
coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the breakfast,&#8221; said the apple-woman;
&#8220;these flowers are most delicious eating. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
never tasted anything so good in your life; but we
don&#8217;t begin till the Queen does.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quantities of blossoms had dropped into the
boat. Several fairies tumbled into it almost head
over heels, they were in such a hurry, and they
heaped them into Mopsa&#8217;s lap, but took no notice
of Jack, nor of the apple-woman either.</p>
<p>At last, when every one had waited some time,
the Queen pulled a petal off one flower, and began
to eat, so every one else began; and what the
apple-woman had said was quite true. Jack knew
that he never had tasted anything half so nice,
and he was quite sorry when he could not eat any
more. So, when every one had finished, the
Queen leaned her arm on the edge of the
boat, and, turning her lovely face towards Mopsa,
said, &#8220;I want to whisper to you, sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Mopsa, &#8220;I wish I was in Jack&#8217;s
waistcoat pocket again; but I&#8217;m so big now.&#8221;
And she took hold of the two sides of his velvet
jacket, and hid her face between them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>&#8220;My old mother sent a message last night,&#8221;
continued the Queen, in a soft, sorrowful voice.
&#8220;She is much more powerful than we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the message?&#8221; asked Mopsa; but she
still hid her face.</p>
<p>So the Queen moved over, and put her lips
close to Mopsa&#8217;s ear, and repeated it: &#8220;There
cannot be two Queens in one hive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Mopsa leaves the hive, a fine swarm will
go with her,&#8221; said the apple-woman. &#8220;I shall,
for one; that I shall!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; answered the Queen. &#8220;I hope not,
dear; for you know well that this is my old
mother&#8217;s doing, not mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Mopsa; &#8220;I feel as if I must tell
a story too, just as the Queen does.&#8221; But the
apple-woman broke out in a very cross voice,
&#8220;It&#8217;s not at all like Fairyland, if you go on in this
way, and I would as lieve be out of it as in it.&#8221;
Then she began to sing, that she and Jack might
not hear Mopsa&#8217;s story:&mdash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>On the rocks by Aberdeen,</p>
<p>Where the whislin&#8217; wave had been,</p>
<p>As I wandered and at e&#8217;en</p>
<p class='indent8'>Was eerie;</p>
<p>There I saw thee sailing west,</p>
<p>And I ran with joy opprest&mdash;</p>
<p>Ay, and took out all my best,</p>
<p class='indent8'>My dearie.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Then I busked mysel&#8217; wi&#8217; speed,</p>
<p>And the neighbors cried &#8220;What need?</p>
<p>&#8217;Tis a lass in any weed</p>
<p class='indent8'>Aye bonny!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now my heart, my heart is sair.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the good, though I be fair,</p>
<p>For thou&#8217;lt never see me mair,</p>
<p class='indent8'>Man Johnnie!</p>
</div></div>
<p>While the apple-woman sang Mopsa finished
her story; and the Queen untied the fastening
which held her carpet to the boat, and went floating
upon it down the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; she said, kissing her hand to
them. &#8220;I must go and prepare for the deputation.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Jack and Mopsa played about all the morning,
sometimes in the boat and sometimes on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
the shore, while the apple-woman sat on the
grass, with her arms folded, and seemed to be
lost in thought. At last she said to Jack, &#8220;What
was the name of the great bird that carried you
two here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have forgotten,&#8221; answered Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been trying to remember ever since we heard
the Queen tell her first story, but I cannot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; said Mopsa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell it then,&#8221; replied the apple-woman; but
Mopsa shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want Jack to go,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go, nor that you should,&#8221;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the Queen said, &#8216;there cannot be two
queens in one hive,&#8217; and that means that you
are going to be turned out of this beautiful
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The other fairy lands are just as nice,&#8221; answered
Mopsa; &#8220;she can only turn me out of
this one.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of more than one Fairyland,&#8221;
observed Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my opinion,&#8221; said the apple-woman,
&#8220;that there are hundreds! And those one-foot-one
fairies are such a saucy set, that if I were
you I should be very glad to get away from
them. You&#8217;ve been here a very little while as
yet, and you&#8217;ve no notion what goes on when
the leaves begin to drop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you must know,&#8221; answered the apple-woman,
&#8220;that fairies cannot abide cold weather;
so, when the first rime frost comes, they bury
themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bury themselves?&#8221; repeated Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I tell you, they bury themselves. You&#8217;ve
seen fairy rings, of course, even in your own
country; and here the fields are full of them.
Well, when it gets cold, a company of fairies
forms itself into a circle, and every one digs a
little hole. The first that has finished jumps into
his hole, and his next neighbor covers him up,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
and then jumps into his own little hole, and
he gets covered up in his turn, till at last there
is only one left, and he goes and joins another
circle, hoping he shall have better luck than
to be last again. I&#8217;ve often asked them why
they do that, but no fairy can ever give a reason
for anything. They always say that old Mother
Fate makes them do it. When they come up
again, they are not fairies at all, but the good
ones are mushrooms, and the bad ones are toadstools.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you think there are no one-foot-one
fairies in the other countries,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; answered the apple-woman;
&#8220;all the fairy lands are different. It&#8217;s only the
queens that are alike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish the fairies would not disappear for
hours,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;They all seem to run off
and hide themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s their way,&#8221; answered the apple-woman.
&#8220;All fairies are part of their time in the shape
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
of human creatures, and the rest of it in the
shape of some animal. These can turn themselves,
when they please, into Guinea-fowl. In
the heat of the day they generally prefer to be
in that form, and they sit among the leaves of
the trees.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;A great many are now with the Queen, because
there is a deputation coming; but if I were
to begin to sing, such a flock of Guinea-hens
would gather round, that the boughs of the trees
would bend with their weight, and they would
light on the grass all about so thickly that not
a blade of grass would be seen as far as the
song was heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she began to sing, and the air was darkened
by great flocks of these Guinea-fowl. They
alighted just as she had said, and kept time with
their heads and their feet, nodding like a crowd
of mandarins; and yet it was nothing but a
stupid old song that you would have thought
could have no particular meaning for them.</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>A land that living warmth disowns,</p>
<p class='indent2'>It meets my wondering ken;</p>
<p>A land where all the men are stones,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Or all the stones are men.</p>
</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Before</span> the apple-woman had finished, Jack
and Mopsa saw the Queen coming in great
state, followed by thousands of the one-foot-one
fairies, and leading by a ribbon round its neck
a beautiful brown doe. A great many pretty
fawns were walking among the fairies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the deputation,&#8221; said the apple-woman;
but as the Guinea-fowl rose like a cloud at the
approach of the Queen, and the fairies and fawns
pressed forward, there was a good deal of noise
and confusion, during which Mopsa stepped up
close to Jack, and whispered in his ear, &#8220;Remember,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
Jack, whatever you can do you may
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the brown doe laid down at Mopsa&#8217;s
feet, and the Queen began:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack and Mopsa, I love you both. I had a
message last night from my old mother, and I
told you what it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Queen,&#8221; said Mopsa, &#8220;you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; continued the Queen, &#8220;she has
sent this beautiful brown doe from the country
beyond the lake, where they are in the greatest
distress for a queen, to offer Mopsa the crown;
and, Jack, it is fated that Mopsa is to reign
there, so you had better say no more about
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be a queen,&#8221; said Mopsa,
pouting; &#8220;I want to play with Jack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a queen already,&#8221; answered the real
Queen; &#8220;at least, you will be in a few days.
You are so much grown, even since the morning,
that you come up nearly to Jack&#8217;s shoulder. In
four days you will be as tall as I am; and it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
is quite impossible that any one of fairy birth
should be as tall as a queen in her own
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t see what stags and does can
want with a queen,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were obliged to turn into deer,&#8221; said
the Queen, &#8220;when they crossed their own border;
but they are fairies when they are at home,
and they want Mopsa, because they are always
obliged to have a queen of alien birth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I go,&#8221; said Mopsa, &#8220;shall Jack go too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; answered the Queen; &#8220;Jack and
the apple-woman are my subjects.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple-woman,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;tell us what you
think; shall Mopsa go to this country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, child,&#8221; said the apple-woman, &#8220;go
away from here she must; but she need not go
off with the deer, I suppose, unless she likes.
They look gentle and harmless; but it is very
hard to get at the truth in this country, and I&#8217;ve
heard queer stories about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you?&#8221; said the Queen. &#8220;Well, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
can repeat them if you like; but remember that
the poor brown doe cannot contradict them.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the apple-woman said, &#8220;I have heard, but
I don&#8217;t know how true it is, that in that country
they shut up their queen in a great castle, and
cover her with a veil, and never let the sun shine
on her; for if by chance the least little sunbeam
should light on her she would turn into a doe
directly, and all the nation would turn with her,
and stay so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be shut up in a castle,&#8221; said
Mopsa.</p>
<p>&#8220;But is it true?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the apple-woman, &#8220;as I told you
before, I cannot make out whether it&#8217;s true or not,
for all these stags and fawns look very mild, gentle
creatures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go,&#8221; said Mopsa; &#8220;I would rather
run away.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this time the Queen with the brown doe
had been gently pressing with the crowd nearer
and nearer to the brink of the river, so that now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
Jack and Mopsa, who stood facing them, were
quite close to the boat; and while they argued
and tried to make Mopsa come away, Jack suddenly
whispered to her to spring into the boat,
which she did, and he after her, and at the same
time he cried out,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, boat, if you are my boat, set off as fast
as you can, and let nothing of fairy birth get on
board of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>No sooner did he begin to speak than the boat
swung itself away from the edge, and almost
in a moment it was in the very middle of the
river, and beginning to float gently down with
the stream.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>

<p class='caption'>
THEY RUN AWAY FROM OLD MOTHER FATE.<br />
<br />
&#8220;The boat swung itself away from the edge, and almost in a moment it was in the very middle of the river.&#8221;&mdash;<span class='smcap'><a href='#page_162'>Page 162</a>.</span><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Now, as I have told you before, that river runs
up the country instead of down to the sea, so
Jack and Mopsa floated still farther up into
Fairyland; and they saw the Queen, and the
apple-woman, and all the crowd of fawns and
fairies walking along the bank of the river, keeping
exactly to the same pace that the boat went;
and this went on for hours and hours, so that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
there seemed to be no chance that Jack and Mopsa
could land; and they heard no voices at all, nor
any sound but the baying of the old hound, who
could not swim out to them, because Jack had
forbidden the boat to take anything of fairy birth
on board of her.</p>
<p>Luckily the bottom of the boat was full of
those delicious flowers that had dropped into it
at breakfast-time, so there was plenty of nice
food for Jack and Mopsa; and Jack noticed, when
he looked at her towards evening, that she was
now nearly as tall as himself, and that her lovely
brown hair floated down to her ankles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; she said, before it grew dusk, &#8220;will
you give me your little purse that has the silver
fourpence in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Mopsa had often played with this purse.
It was lined with a nice piece of pale green silk,
and when Jack gave it to her she pulled the silk
out, and shook it, and patted it, and stretched it,
just as the Queen had done, and it came into
a most lovely cloak, which she tied round her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
neck. Then she twisted up her long hair into
a coil, and fastened it round her head, and called
to the fire-flies which were beginning to glitter
on the trees to come, and they came and alighted
in a row upon the coil, and turned into diamonds
directly. So now Mopsa had got a crown and a
robe, and she was so beautiful that Jack thought
he should never be tired of looking at her; but
it was nearly dark now, and he was so sleepy
and tired that he could not keep his eyes open,
though he tried very hard, and he began to
blink, and then he began to nod, and at last
he fell fast asleep, and did not awake till the
morning.</p>
<p>Then he sat up in the boat, and looked about
him. A wonderful country, indeed!&mdash;no trees,
no grass, no houses, nothing but red stones and
red sand,&mdash;and Mopsa was gone. Jack jumped
on shore, for the boat had stopped, and was close
to the brink of the river. He looked about for
some time, and at last, in the shadow of a pale
brown rock, he found her; and oh! delightful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
surprise, the apple-woman was there too. She
was saying, &#8220;O my bones! Dearie, dearie me,
how they do ache!&#8221; That was not surprising,
for she had been out all night. She had walked
beside the river with the Queen and her tribe
till they came to a little tinkling stream, which
divides their country from the sandy land, and
there they were obliged to stop; they could not
cross it. But the apple-woman sprang over, and,
though the Queen told her she must come back
again in twenty-four hours, she did not appear
to be displeased. Now the Guinea-hens, when
they had come to listen, the day before, to the
apple-woman&#8217;s song, had brought each of them
a grain of maize in her beak, and had thrown
it into her apron; so when she got up she carried
it with her gathered up there, and now she had
been baking some delicious little cakes on a fire
of dry sticks that the river had drifted down,
and Mopsa had taken a honeycomb from the
rock, so that they all had a very nice breakfast.
And the apple-woman gave them a great deal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
of good advice, and told them if they wished to
remain in Fairyland, and not be caught by the
brown doe and her followers, they must cross
over the purple mountains. &#8220;For on the other
side of those peaks,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I have heard
that fairies live who have the best of characters
for being kind and just. I am sure they would
never shut up a poor queen in a castle.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the best thing you could do, dear,&#8221; she
said to Mopsa, &#8220;would be to let Jack call the
bird, and make her carry you back to his own
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Queen is not at all kind,&#8221; said Jack;
&#8220;I have been very kind to her, and she should
have let Mopsa stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Jack, she could not,&#8221; said Mopsa; &#8220;but
I wish I had not grown so fast, and I don&#8217;t like
to go to your country. I would rather run away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But who is to tell us where to run?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Mopsa, &#8220;some of these people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anybody,&#8221; said Jack, looking
about him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>Mopsa pointed to a group of stones, and then
to another group, and as Jack looked he saw
that in shape they were something like people,&mdash;stone
people. One stone was a little like an
old man with a mantle over him, and he was
sitting on the ground with his knees up nearly
to his chin. Another was like a woman with a
hood on, and she seemed to be leaning her chin
on her hand. Close to these stood something
very much like a cradle in shape; and beyond
were stones that resembled a flock of sheep lying
down on the bare sand, with something that reminded
Jack of the figure of a man lying asleep
near them, with his face to the ground.</p>
<p>That was a very curious country; all the stones
reminded you of people or of animals, and the
shadows that they cast were much more like
than the stones themselves. There were blocks
with things that you might have mistaken for
stone ropes twisted round them; but, looking at
the shadows, you could see distinctly that they
were trees, and that what coiled round were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
snakes. Then there was a rocky prominence, at
one side of which was something like a sitting
figure, but its shadow, lying on the ground, was
that of a girl with a distaff. Jack was very
much surprised at all this; Mopsa was not. She
did not see, she said, that one thing was more
wonderful than another. All the fairy lands were
wonderful, but the men-and-women world was
far more so. She and Jack went about among
the stones all day, and as the sun got low both
the shadows and the blocks themselves became
more and more like people, and if you went close
you could now see features, very sweet, quiet
features, but the eyes were all shut.</p>
<p>By this time the apple-woman began to feel
very sad. She knew she should soon have to
leave Jack and Mopsa, and she said to Mopsa,
as they finished their evening meal, &#8220;I wish
you would ask the inhabitants a few questions,
dear, before I go, for I want to know whether
they can put you in the way how to cross the
purple mountains.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>Jack said nothing, for he thought he would see
what Mopsa was going to do; so when she got
up and went towards the shape that was like
a cradle he followed, and the apple-woman
too. Mopsa went to the figure that sat by the
cradle. It was a stone yet, but when Mopsa
laid her little warm hand on its bosom it
smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear,&#8221; said Mopsa, &#8220;I wish you would
wake.&#8221;</p>
<p>A curious little sound was now heard, but
the figure did not move, and the apple-woman
lifted Mopsa on to the lap of the statue; then
she put her arms round its neck, and spoke to it
again very distinctly: &#8220;Dear! why don&#8217;t you wake?
You had better wake now; the baby&#8217;s crying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack now observed that the sound he had
heard was something like the crying of a baby.
He also heard the figure answering Mopsa. It
said, &#8220;I am only a stone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Mopsa, &#8220;I am not a queen yet.
I cannot wake her. Take me down.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I am not warm,&#8221; said the figure; and that
was quite true, and yet she was not a stone now
which reminded one of a woman, but a woman
that reminded one of a stone.</p>
<p>All the west was very red with the sunset,
and the river was red too, and Jack distinctly
saw some of the coils of rope glide down from
the trees and slip into the water; next he saw
the stones that had looked like sheep raise up
their heads in the twilight, and then lift themselves
and shake their woolly sides. At that
instant the large white moon heaved up her
pale face between two dark blue hills, and upon
this the statue put out its feet and gently rocked
the cradle.</p>
<p>Then it spoke again to Mopsa: &#8220;What was it
that you wished me to tell you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How to find the way over those purple mountains,&#8221;
said Mopsa.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must set off in an hour, then,&#8221; said the
woman; and she had hardly anything of the stone
about her now. &#8220;You can easily find it by night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
without any guide, but nothing can ever take you
to it by day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we would rather stay a few days in this
curious country,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;let us wait at least
till to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statue at this moment rubbed her hands
together, as if they still felt cold and stiff. &#8220;You
are quite welcome to stay,&#8221; she observed; &#8220;but
you had better not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; persisted Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said the woman, rising and shaking
the figure next to her by the sleeve, &#8220;Wake up!&#8221;
What had looked like an old man was a real
old man now, and he got up and began to gather
sticks to make a fire, and to pick up the little
brown stones which had been scattered about
all day, but which now were berries of coffee;
the larger ones, which you might find here and
there, were rasped rolls. Then the woman answered
Jack, &#8220;Why not? Why, because it&#8217;s full
moon to-night at midnight, and the moment the
moon is past the full your Queen, whose country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
you have just left, will be able to cross over the
little stream, and she will want to take you and
that other mortal back. She can do it, of course,
if she pleases; and we can afford you no protection,
for by that time we shall be stones again.
We are only people two hours out of the twenty-four.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very hard,&#8221; observed Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the woman, in a tone of indifference;
&#8220;it comes to the same thing, as we live
twelve times as long as others do.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time the shepherd was gently driving his
flock down to the water, and round fifty little fires
groups of people were sitting roasting coffee,
while cows were lowing to be milked, and girls
with distaffs were coming to them slowly, for no
one was in a hurry there. They say in that country
that they wish to enjoy their day quietly,
because it is so short.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell us anything of the land beyond
the mountains?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;Of all fairy lands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
it is the best; the people are the gentlest and
kindest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I had better take Mopsa there than down
the river?&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t take her down the river,&#8221; replied
the woman; and Jack thought she laughed and
was glad of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Jack. &#8220;I have a boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered the woman; &#8220;but where
is it now?&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Rosalind.</i>&mdash;Well, this is the forest of Arden.</p>
<p><i>Touchstone.</i>&mdash;Ay, now am I in Arden: the more fool
I; when I was at home I was in a better place; but travellers
must be content.</p>
<p class='sig1'><i>As you Like it.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&#8220;</small><span class='drop'>W</span><span class='dcap'>here</span> is it now?&#8221; said the stone-woman;
and when Jack heard that he ran down to
the river, and looked right and looked left. At
last he saw his boat,&mdash;a mere speck in the distance,
it had floated so far.</p>
<p>He called it, but it was far beyond the reach
of his voice; and Mopsa, who had followed him,
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does not signify, Jack, for I feel that no
place is the right place for me but that country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
beyond the purple mountains, and I shall never be
happy unless we go there.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they walked back towards the stone-people
hand in hand, and the apple-woman presently
joined them. She was crying gently, for she
knew that she must soon pass over the little
stream, and part with these whom she called her
dear children. Jack had often spoken to her that
day about going home to her own country, but
she said it was too late to think of that now, and
she must end her days in the land of Faery.</p>
<p>The kind stone-people asked them to come and
sit by their little fire; and in the dusk the woman
whose baby had slept in a stone cradle took it up
and began to sing to it. She seemed astonished
when she heard that the apple-woman had power
to go home if she could make up her mind to do
it; and as she sang she looked at her with wonder
and pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not exactly fairies, I suppose?&#8221; said
Jack. &#8220;If you were, you could go to our country
when you pleased.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the woman; &#8220;we are not exactly
fairies; but we shall be more like them when our
punishment is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry you are punished,&#8221; answered Jack,
&#8220;for you seem very nice, kind people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were not always kind,&#8221; answered the
woman; &#8220;and perhaps we are only kind now
because we have no time, and no chance of being
otherwise. I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know about that.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
We were powerful once, and we did a cruel deed.
I must not tell you what it was. We were told
that our hearts were all as cold as stones,&mdash;and I
suppose they were,&mdash;and we were doomed to be
stones all our lives, excepting for the two hours of
twilight. There was no one to sow the crops, or
water the grass, so it all failed, and the trees died,
and our houses fell, and our possessions were
stolen from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a very sad thing,&#8221; observed the apple-woman;
and then she said that she must go, for
she had a long way to walk before she should
reach the little brook that led to the country of
her own queen; so she kissed the two children,
Jack and Mopsa, and they begged her again to
think better of it, and return to her own land.
But she said No; she had no heart for work
now, and could not bear either cold or poverty.</p>
<p>Then the woman who was hugging her little
baby, and keeping it cosy and warm, began to
tell Jack and Mopsa that it was time they should
begin to run away to the country over the purple
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
mountains, or else the Queen would overtake
them and be very angry with them; so, with
many promises that they would mind her directions,
they set off hand in hand to run; but before
they left her they could see plainly that she
was beginning to turn again into stone. However,
she had given them a slice of melon with
the seeds in it. It had been growing on the
edge of the river, and was stone in the day-time,
like everything else. &#8220;When you are tired,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;eat the seeds, and they will enable
you to go running on. You can put the slice
into this little red pot, which has string handles
to it, and you can hang it on your arm. While
you have it with you it will not turn to stone,
but if you lay it down it will, and then it will
be useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, as I said before, Jack and Mopsa set off
hand in hand to run; and as they ran all the
things and people gradually and softly settled
themselves to turn into stone again. Their cloaks
and gowns left off fluttering, and hung stiffly;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
and then they left off their occupations, and sat
down, or laid down themselves; and the sheep
and cattle turned stiff and stone-like too, so that
in a very little while all that country was nothing
but red stones and red sand, just as it had been
in the morning.</p>
<p>Presently the full moon, which had been hiding
behind a cloud, came out, and they saw their
shadows, which fell straight before them; so
they ran on hand in hand very merrily till the
half-moon came up, and the shadows she made
them cast fell sideways. This was rather awkward,
because as long as only the full moon
gave them shadows, they had but to follow them,
in order to go straight towards the purple mountains.
Now they were not always sure which
were her shadows: and presently a crescent moon
came, and still further confused them; also the
sand began to have tufts of grass in it; and then,
when they had gone a little farther, there were
beautiful patches of anemones, and hyacinths, and
jonquils, and crown imperials, and they stopped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
to gather them; and they got among some trees,
and then, as they had nothing to guide them but
the shadows, and these went all sorts of ways,
they lost a great deal of time, and the trees
became of taller growth; but they still ran on
and on till they got into a thick forest where it
was quite dark, and here Mopsa began to cry,
for she was tired.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could only begin to be a queen,&#8221; she
said to Jack, &#8220;I could go wherever I pleased.
I am not a fairy, and yet I am not a proper
queen. Oh, what shall I do? I cannot go any
farther.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Jack gave her some of the seeds of the
melon, though it was so dark that he could
scarcely find the way to her mouth, and then
he took some himself, and they both felt that
they were rested, and Jack comforted Mopsa.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are not a queen yet,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you
will be by to-morrow morning; for when our
shadows danced on before us yours was so very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
nearly the same height as mine, that I could
hardly see any difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they reached the end of that great
forest, and found themselves out in all sorts of
moonlight, the first thing they did was to laugh,&mdash;the
shadows looked so odd, sticking out in
every direction; and the next thing they did
was to stand back to back, and put their heels
together, and touch their heads together, to see
by the shadow which was the taller; and Jack
was still the least bit in the world taller than
Mopsa; so they knew she was not a queen yet,
and they ate some more melon-seeds, and began
to climb up the mountain.</p>
<p>They climbed till the trees of the forest looked
no bigger than gooseberry bushes, and then they
climbed till the whole forest looked only like a
patch of moss; and then, when they got a little
higher, they saw the wonderful river, a long way
off, and the snow glittering on the peaks overhead;
and while they were looking and wondering
how they should find a pass, the moons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
all went down, one after the other, and, if
Mopsa had not found some glowworms, they
would have been quite in the dark again. However,
she took a dozen of them, and put them
round Jack&#8217;s ankles, so that when he walked
he could see where he was going; and he found
a little sheep-path, and she followed him.</p>
<p>Now they had noticed during the night how
many shooting-stars kept darting about from time
to time, and at last one shot close by them, and
fell in the soft moss on before. There it lay
shining; and Jack, though he began to feel very
tired again, made haste to it, for he wanted to
see what it was like.</p>
<p>It was not what you would have supposed.
It was soft and round, and about the color of
a ripe apricot; it was covered with fur, and in
fact it was evidently alive, and had curled itself
up into a round ball.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dear little thing!&#8221; said Jack, as he held
it in his hand, and showed it to Mopsa; &#8220;how
its heart beats. Is it frightened?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; said Mopsa to the thing.
&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>The little creature made a sound that seemed
like &#8220;Wisp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncurl yourself, Wisp,&#8221; said Mopsa. &#8220;Jack
and I want to look at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Wisp unfolded himself, and showed two
little black eyes, and spread out two long filmy
wings. He was like a most beautiful bat, and
the light he shed out illuminated their faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only one of the air fairies,&#8221; said Mopsa.
&#8220;Pretty creature! It never did any harm, and
would like to do us good if it knew how, for it
knows that I shall be a queen very soon. Wisp,
if you like, you may go and tell your friends and
relations that we want to cross over the mountains,
and if they can they may help us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon this Wisp spread out his wings, and
shot off again; and Jack&#8217;s feet were so tired
that he sat down, and pulled off one of his
shoes, for he thought there was a stone in it.
So he set the little red jar beside him, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
quite forgot what the stone-woman had said, but
went on shaking his shoe, and buckling it, and
admiring the glowworms round his ankle, till
Mopsa said, &#8220;Darling Jack, I am so dreadfully
tired! Give me some more melon-seeds.&#8221; Then
he lifted up the jar, and thought it felt very
heavy; and when he put in his hand, jar, and
melon, and seeds were all turned to stone
together.</p>
<p>They were both very sorry, and they sat still
for a minute or two, for they were much too
tired to stir; and then shooting-stars began to
appear in all directions. The fairy bat had told
his friends and relations, and they were coming.
One fell at Mopsa&#8217;s feet, another in her lap;
more, more, all about, behind, before, and over
them. And they spread out long filmy wings,
some of them a yard long, till Jack and Mopsa
seemed to be enclosed in a perfect network of
the rays of shooting-stars, and they were both a
good deal frightened. Fifty or sixty shooting-stars,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
with black eyes that could stare, were enough, they
thought, to frighten anybody.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we had anything to sit upon,&#8221; said Mopsa,
&#8220;they could carry us over the pass.&#8221; She had
no sooner spoken than the largest of the bats
bit off one of his own long wings, and laid it
at Mopsa&#8217;s feet. It did not seem to matter much
to him that he had parted with it, for he shot
out another wing directly, just as a comet shoots
out a ray of light sometimes, when it approaches
the sun.</p>
<p>Mopsa thanked the shooting fairy, and, taking
the wing, began to stretch it, till it was large
enough for her and Jack to sit upon. Then all
the shooting fairies came round it, took its edges
in their mouths, and began to fly away with it
over the mountains. They went slowly, for Jack
and Mopsa were heavy, and they flew very low,
resting now and then; but in the course of time
they carried the wing over the pass, and halfway
down the other side. Then the sun came up;
and the moment he appeared all their lovely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
apricot-colored light was gone, and they only
looked like common bats, such as you can see
every evening.</p>
<p>They set down Jack and Mopsa, folded up their
long wings, and hung down their heads.</p>
<p>Mopsa thanked them, and said they had been
useful; but still they looked ashamed, and crept
into little corners and crevices of the rock, to
hide.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>There</span> were many fruit-trees on that slope
of the mountain, and Jack and Mopsa, as
they came down, gathered some fruit for breakfast,
and did not feel very tired, for the long ride
on the wing had rested them.</p>
<p>They could not see the plain, for a slight blue
mist hung over it; but the sun was hot already,
and as they came down they saw a beautiful bed
of high reeds, and thought they would sit awhile
and rest in it. A rill of clear water ran beside
the bed, so when they had reached it they sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
down, and began to consider what they should
do next.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; said Mopsa, &#8220;did you see anything
particular as you came down with the shooting-stars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I saw nothing so interesting as they
were,&#8221; answered Jack. &#8220;I was looking at them
and watching how they squeaked to one another,
and how they had little hooks in their wings,
with which they held the large wing that we
sat on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I saw something,&#8221; said Mopsa. &#8220;Just
as the sun rose I looked down, and in the loveliest
garden I ever saw, and all among trees and
woods, I saw a most beautiful castle. O, Jack!
I am sure that castle is the place I am to live
in, and now we have nothing to do but to find
it. I shall soon be a queen, and there I shall
reign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shall be king there,&#8221; said Jack;
&#8220;shall I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if you can,&#8221; answered Mopsa. &#8220;Of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
course, whatever you can do you may do. And,
Jack, this is a much better fairy country than
either the stony land or the other that we first
came to, for this castle is a real place! It will
not melt away. There the people can work,
they know how to love each other: common
fairies cannot do that, I know. They can laugh
and cry, and I shall teach them several things
that they do not know yet. Oh! do let us make
haste and find the castle.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they arose; but they turned the wrong
way, and by mistake walked farther and farther
in among the reeds, whose feathery heads puffed
into Mopsa&#8217;s face, and Jack&#8217;s coat was all covered
with the fluffy seed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is very odd,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;I thought
this was only a small bed of reeds when we
stepped into it; but really we must have walked
a mile already.&#8221;</p>
<p>But they walked on and on, till Mopsa grew
quite faint, and her sweet face became very pale,
for she knew that the beds of reeds were spreading
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
faster than they walked, and then they shot
up so high that it was impossible to see over
their heads; so at last Jack and Mopsa were so
tired that they sat down, and Mopsa began to cry.</p>
<p>However, Jack was the braver of the two this
time, and he comforted Mopsa, and told her that
she was nearly a queen, and would never reach
her castle by sitting still. So she got up and
took his hand, and he went on before, parting
the reeds and pulling her after him, till all on
a sudden they heard the sweetest sound in the
world; it was like a bell, and it sounded again
and again.</p>
<p>It was the castle clock, and it was striking
twelve at noon.</p>
<p>As it finished striking they came out at the
farther edge of the great bed of reeds, and there
was the castle straight before them,&mdash;a beautiful
castle, standing on the slope of a hill. The grass
all about it was covered with beautiful flowers;
two of the taller turrets were overgrown with
ivy, and a flag was flying on a staff; but everything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
was so silent and lonely that it made one
sad to look on. As Jack and Mopsa drew near
they trod as gently as they could, and did not
say a word.</p>
<p>All the windows were shut, but there was a
great door in the centre of the building, and they
went towards it, hand in hand.</p>
<p>What a beautiful hall! The great door stood
wide open, and they could see what a delightful
place this must be to live in: it was paved with
squares of blue and white marble, and here and
there carpets were spread, with chairs and tables
upon them. They looked and saw a great dome
overhead, filled with windows of colored glass,
and they cast down blue and golden and rosy
reflections.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is my home that I shall live in,&#8221; said
Mopsa; and she came close to the door, and
they both looked in, till at last she let go of
Jack&#8217;s hand, and stepped over the threshold.</p>
<p>The bell in the tower sounded again more
sweetly than ever, and the instant Mopsa was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
inside there came from behind the fluted columns,
which rose up on every side, the brown doe, followed
by troops of deer and fawns!</p>
<p>&#8220;Mopsa! Mopsa!&#8221; cried Jack, &#8220;come away!
come back!&#8221; But Mopsa was too much astonished
to stir, and something seemed to hold Jack
from following; but he looked and looked, till,
as the brown doe advanced, the door of the castle
closed,&mdash;Mopsa was shut in, and Jack was left
outside.</p>
<p>So Mopsa had come straight to the place she
thought she had ran away from.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am determined to get her away from
those creatures,&#8221; thought Jack; &#8220;she does not
want to reign over deer.&#8221; And he began to look
about him, hoping to get in. It was of no use:
all the windows in that front of the castle were
high, and when he tried to go round, he came
to a high wall with battlements. Against some
parts of this wall the ivy grew, and looked as
if it might have grown there for ages; its stems
were thicker than his waist, and its branches
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
were spread over the surface like network; so
by means of them he hoped to climb to the top.</p>
<p>He immediately began to try. Oh, how high
the wall was! First he came to several sparrows&#8217;
nests, and very much frightened the sparrows
were; then he reached starlings&#8217; nests, and very
angry the starlings were; but at last, just under
the coping, he came to jackdaws&#8217; nests, and
these birds were very friendly, and pointed out
to him the best little holes for him to put his feet
into. At last he reached the top, and found to
his delight that the wall was three feet thick, and
he could walk upon it quite comfortably, and
look down into a lovely garden, where all the
trees were in blossom, and creepers tossed their
long tendrils from tree to tree, covered with puffs
of yellow, or bells of white, or bunches and knots
of blue or rosy bloom.</p>
<p>He could look down into the beautiful empty
rooms of the castle, and he walked cautiously on
the wall till he came to the west front, and reached
a little casement window that had latticed panes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
Jack peeped in; nobody was there. He took his
knife, and cut away a little bit of lead to let out
the pane, and it fell with such a crash on the
pavement below that he wondered it did not bring
the deer over to look at what he was about.
Nobody came.</p>
<p>He put in his hand and opened the latchet, and
with very little trouble got down into the room.
Still nobody was to be seen. He thought that
the room, years ago, might have been a fairies&#8217;
school-room, for it was strewn with books, slates,
and all sorts of copybooks. A fine soft dust had
settled down over everything,&mdash;pens, papers, and
all. Jack opened a copybook: its pages were
headed with maxims, just as ours are, which
proved that these fairies must have been superior
to such as he had hitherto come among. Jack
read some of them:&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem' style='width: 25em'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Turn your back on the light, and you&#8217;ll follow a shadow.</p>
<p>The deaf queen Fate has dumb courtiers.</p>
<p>If the hound is your foe, don&#8217;t sleep in his kennel.</p>
<p>That that is, is.</p>
</div></div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>And so on; but nobody came, and no sound was
heard, so he opened the door, and found himself
in a long and most splendid gallery, all
hung with pictures, and spread with a most beautiful
carpet, which was as soft and white as a
piece of wool, and wrought with a beautiful
device. This was the letter M, with a crown
and sceptre, and underneath a beautiful little boat,
exactly like the one in which he had come up the
river. Jack felt sure that this carpet had been
made for Mopsa, and he went along the gallery
upon it till he reached a grand staircase of oak
that was almost black with age, and he stole
gently down it, for he began to feel rather shy,
more especially as he could now see the great
hall under the dome, and that it had a beautiful
lady in it, and many other people, but no deer
at all.</p>
<p>These fairy people were something like the
one-foot-one fairies, but much larger and more
like children; and they had very gentle, happy
faces, and seemed to be extremely glad and gay.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
But seated on a couch, where lovely painted
windows threw down all sorts of rainbow colors
on her, was a beautiful fairy lady, as large as a
woman. She had Mopsa in her arms, and was
looking down upon her with eyes full of love,
while at her side stood a boy, who was exactly
and precisely like Jack himself. He had rather
long light hair and gray eyes, and a velvet jacket.
That was all Jack could see at first, but as he
drew nearer the boy turned, and then Jack felt as
if he was looking at himself in the glass.</p>
<p>Mopsa had been very tired, and now she was
fast asleep, with her head on that lady&#8217;s shoulder.
The boy kept looking at her, and he seemed very
happy indeed; so did the lady, and she presently
told him to bring Jack something to eat.</p>
<p>It was rather a curious speech that she made
to him; it was this:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, bring Jack some breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; thought Jack to himself, &#8220;has he
got a face like mine, and a name like mine
too?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>So that other Jack went away, and presently
came back with a golden plate full of nice things
to eat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you don&#8217;t like me,&#8221; he said, as he
came up to Jack with the plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not like him?&#8221; repeated the lady; &#8220;and
pray what reason have you for not liking my
royal nephew?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O dame!&#8221; exclaimed the boy, and laughed.</p>
<p>The lady, on hearing this, turned pale, for she
perceived that she herself had mistaken the one
for the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you know how to laugh,&#8221; said the real
Jack. &#8220;You are wiser people than those whom
I went to first; but the reason I don&#8217;t like you
is, that you are so exactly like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not!&#8221; exclaimed the boy. &#8220;Only hear
him, dame! You mean, I suppose, that you are
so exactly like me. I am sure I don&#8217;t know what
you mean by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I either,&#8221; replied Jack, almost in a passion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t be helped, of course,&#8221; said the
other Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush! hush!&#8221; said the fairy woman; &#8220;don&#8217;t
wake our dear little Queen. Was it you, my
royal nephew, who spoke last?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dame,&#8221; answered the boy, and again he
offered the plate; but Jack was swelling with
indignation, and he gave the plate a push with
his elbow, which scattered the fruit and bread
on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t eat it,&#8221; he said; but when the other
Jack went and picked it up again, and said,
&#8220;Oh, yes, do, old fellow; it&#8217;s not my fault, you
know,&#8221; he began to consider that it was no use
being cross in Fairyland; so he forgave his
double, and had just finished his breakfast when
Mopsa woke.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br /><br />THE QUEEN&#8217;S WAND.</h2>
</div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>One, two, three, four; one, two, three, four;</p>
<p class='indent2'>&#8217;Tis still one, two, three, four.</p>
<p>Mellow and silvery are the tones,</p>
<p class='indent2'>But I wish the bells were more.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>Southey.</span></p>
</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Mopsa</span> woke: she was rather too big to
be nursed, for she was the size of Jack,
and looked like a sweet little girl of ten years,
but she did not always behave like one; sometimes
she spoke as wisely as a grown-up woman,
and sometimes she changed again and seemed
like a child.</p>
<p>Mopsa lifted up her head and pushed back
her long hair: her coronet had fallen off while
she was in the bed of reeds; and she said to
the beautiful dame,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a queen now.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my sweet Queen,&#8221; answered the lady,
&#8220;I know you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you promise that you will be kind to
me till I grow up,&#8221; said Mopsa, &#8220;and love me,
and teach me how to reign?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; repeated the lady; &#8220;and I will love
you too, just as if you were a mortal and I your
mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For I am only ten years old yet,&#8221; said
Mopsa, &#8220;and the throne is too big for me to sit
upon; but I am a queen.&#8221; And then she paused,
and said, &#8220;Is it three o&#8217;clock?&#8221;</p>
<p>As she spoke, the sweet, clear bell of the castle
sounded three times, and then chimes began to
play: they played such a joyous tune that it
made everybody sing. The dame sang, the crowd
of fairies sang, the boy who was Jack&#8217;s double
sang, and Mopsa sang,&mdash;only Jack was silent,&mdash;and
this was the song:&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>The prince shall to the chase again,</p>
<p>The dame has got her face again,</p>
<p>The king shall have his place again</p>
<p class='indent2'>Aneath the fairy dome.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>And all the knights shall woo again,</p>
<p>And all the doves shall coo again,</p>
<p>And all the dreams come true again,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And Jack shall go home.</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;We shall see about that!&#8221; thought Jack to
himself. And Mopsa, while she sang those last
words, burst into tears, which Jack did not like
to see; but all the fairies were so very glad, so
joyous, and so delighted with her for having
come to be their queen, that after a while she
dried her eyes, and said to the wrong boy,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, when I pulled the lining out of your
pocket-book there was a silver fourpence in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the real Jack, &#8220;and here it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it real money?&#8221; asked Mopsa. &#8220;Are you
sure you brought it with you all the way from
your own country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;quite sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, dear Jack,&#8221; answered Mopsa, &#8220;will
you give it to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;if you will send this boy
away.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How can I?&#8221; answered Mopsa, surprised.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know what happened when the door
closed? Has nobody told you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not see any one after I got into the
place,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;There was no one to tell
anything,&mdash;not even a fawn, nor the brown doe.
I have only seen down here these fairy people,
and this boy, and this lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lady is the brown doe,&#8221; answered Mopsa;
&#8220;and this boy and the fairies were the fawns.&#8221;
Jack was so astonished at this that he stared at
the lady and the boy and the fairies with all
his might.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sun came shining in as I stepped inside,&#8221;
said Mopsa, &#8220;and a long beam fell down
from the fairy dome across my feet. Do you
remember what the apple-woman told us,&mdash;how
it was reported that the brown doe and her
nation had a queen whom they shut up, and
never let the sun shine on her? That was not
a kind or true report, and yet it came from
something that really happened.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;and if the
sun did shine they were all to be turned into
deer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare not tell you all that story yet,&#8221; said
Mopsa; &#8220;but, Jack, as the brown doe and all
the fawns came up to greet me, and passed by
turns into the sunbeam, they took their own
forms, every one of them, because the spell was
broken. They were to remain in the disguise
of deer till a queen of alien birth should come
to them against her will. I am a queen of
alien birth, and did not I come against my
will?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to be sure,&#8221; answered Jack. &#8220;We
thought all the time that we were running
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If ever you come to Fairyland again,&#8221; observed
Mopsa, &#8220;you can save yourself the
trouble of trying to run away from the old
mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not &#8216;come,&#8217;&#8221; answered Jack, &#8220;because
I shall not go,&mdash;not for a long while, at least.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
But the boy,&mdash;I want to know why this boy
turned into another <span class='smcaplc'>ME</span>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he is the heir, of course,&#8221; answered
Mopsa.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t see that this is any reason at all,&#8221;
said Jack.</p>
<p>Mopsa laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s because you don&#8217;t
know how to argue,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Why, the
thing is as plain as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be plain to you,&#8221; persisted Jack, &#8220;but
it&#8217;s no reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No reason!&#8221; repeated Mopsa, &#8220;no reason!
when I like you the best of anything in the world,
and when I am come here to be queen? Of
course, when the spell was broken he took exactly
your form on that account; and very right too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>Mopsa, however, was like other fairies in this respect,&mdash;that
she knew all about Old Mother Fate,
but not about causes and reasons. She believed,
as we do in this world, that</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>That that is, is;</p>
</div></div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>but the fairies go further than this; they
say:&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>That that is, is; and when it is, that is the reason that it is.</p>
</div></div>
<p>This sounds like nonsense to us, but it is all right
to them.</p>
<p>So Mopsa, thinking she had explained everything,
said again,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, dear Jack, will you give the silver fourpence
to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack took it out; and she got down from the
dame&#8217;s knee and took it in the palm of her hand,
laying the other palm upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be very hot,&#8221; observed the dame.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it will not burn me so as really to hurt,
if I am a real queen,&#8221; said Mopsa.</p>
<p>Presently she began to look as if something gave
her pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s so hot!&#8221; she said to the other Jack;
&#8220;so very hot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, sweet Queen,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;it
will not hurt you long. Remember my poor
uncle and all his knights.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>Mopsa still held the little silver coin; but Jack
saw that it hurt her, for two bright tears fell from
her eyes; and in another moment he saw that
it was actually melted, for it fell in glittering drops
from Mopsa&#8217;s hand to the marble floor, and there
it lay as soft as quicksilver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pick it up,&#8221; said Mopsa to the other Jack;
and he instantly did so, and laid it in her hand
again; and she began gently to roll it backwards
and forwards between her palms till she had
rolled it into a very slender rod, two feet long,
and not nearly so thick as a pin; but it did not
bend, and it shone so brightly that you could
hardly look at it.</p>
<p>Then she held it out towards the real Jack,
and said, &#8220;Give this a name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began the other Jack;
but the dame suddenly stopped him. &#8220;Silence,
sire! Don&#8217;t you know that what it is first called
that it will be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack hesitated; he thought if Mopsa was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
queen the thing ought to be a sceptre; but it certainly
was not at all like a sceptre.</p>
<p>&#8220;That thing is a wand,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a wand,&#8221; said Mopsa, speaking to
the silver stick, which was glittering now in a
sunbeam almost as if it were a beam of light
itself. Then she spoke again to Jack:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, Jack, what can I do with a wand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the boy-king began to speak, and the
dame stopped him, and again Jack considered.
He had heard a great deal in his own country
about fairy wands, but he could not remember
that the fairies had done anything particular
with them, so he gave what he thought was
true, but what seemed to him a very stupid
answer:</p>
<p>&#8220;You can make it point to anything that you
please.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment he had said this, shouts of ecstasy
filled the hall, and all the fairies clapped their
hands with such hurrahs of delight that he blushed
for joy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>The dame also looked truly glad, and as for
the other Jack, he actually turned head over
heels, just as Jack had often done himself on his
father&#8217;s lawn.</p>
<p>Jack had merely meant that Mopsa could point
with the wand to anything that she saw; but
he was presently told that what he had meant
was nothing, and that his words were everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make it point now,&#8221; said Mopsa, &#8220;and
it will point aright to anything I please, whether
I know where the thing is or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the hall was filled with those cries of
joy, and the sweet, child-like fairies congratulated
each other with &#8220;The Queen has got a
wand,&mdash;a wand! and she can make it point
wherever she pleases!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Mopsa rose and walked towards the
beautiful staircase, the dame and all the fairies
following. Jack was going too, but the other
Jack held him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Mopsa going? and why am I not
to follow?&#8221; inquired Jack.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></div>
<p>&#8220;They are going to put on her robes, of
course,&#8221; answered the other Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so tired of always hearing you say
&#8216;of course,&#8217;&#8221; answered Jack; &#8220;and I wonder
how it is that you always seem to know what
is going to be done without being told. However,
I suppose you can&#8217;t help being odd people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy-king did not make a direct answer;
he only said, &#8220;I like you very much, though
you don&#8217;t like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you like me?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>So he opened his eyes wide with surprise:
&#8220;Most boys say Sire to me,&#8221; he observed; &#8220;at least
they used to do when there were any boys here.
However, that does not signify. Why, of course
I like you, because I am so tired of being always
a fawn, and you brought Mopsa to break the
spell. You cannot think how disagreeable it is
to have no hands, and to be all covered with
hair. Now look at my hands; I can move them
and turn them everywhere, even over my head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
if I like. Hoofs are good for nothing in comparison;
and we could not talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do tell me about it,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;How did
you become fawns?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare not tell you,&#8221; said the boy; &#8220;and
listen!&mdash;I hear Mopsa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack looked, and certainly Mopsa was coming,
but very strangely, he thought. Mopsa, like all
other fairies, was afraid to whisper a spell with
her eyes open; so a handkerchief was tied across
them, and as she came on she felt her way,
holding by the banisters with one hand, and with
the other, between her finger and thumb, holding
out the silver wand. She felt with her foot for
the edge of the first stair; and Jack heard her
say, &#8220;I am much older,&mdash;ah! so much older,
now I have got my wand. I can feel sorrow
too, and <i>their</i> sorrow weighs down my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mopsa was dressed superbly in a white satin
gown, with a long, long train of crimson velvet
which was glittering with diamonds; it reached
almost from one end of the great gallery to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
other, and had hundreds of fairies to hold it and
keep it in its place. But in her hair were no
jewels, only a little crown made of daisies, and
on her shoulders her robe was fastened with the
little golden image of a boat. These things were
to show the land she had come from and the
vessel she had come in.</p>
<p>So she came slowly, slowly down stairs blindfold,
and muttering to her wand all the time:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Though the sun shine brightly,</p>
<p>Wand, wand, guide rightly.</p>
</div></div>
<p>So she felt her way down to the great hall.
There the wand turned half round in the hall
toward the great door, and she and Jack and the
other Jack came out into the lawn in front with
all the followers and trainbearers; only the dame
remained behind.</p>
<p>Jack noticed now for the first time that, with
the one exception of the boy-king, all these fairies
were lady-fairies; he also observed that Mopsa,
after the manner of fairy queens, though she
moved slowly and blindfold, was beginning to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
tell a story. This time it did not make him feel
sleepy. It did not begin at the beginning: their
stories never do.</p>
<p>These are the first words he heard, for she
spoke softly and very low, while he walked at
her right hand, and the other Jack on her left:</p>
<p>&#8220;And so now I have no wings. But my
thoughts can go up (Jovinian and Roxaletta
could not think). My thoughts are instead of
wings; but they have dropped with me now, as
a lark among the clods of the valley. Wand, do
you bend? Yes, I am following, wand.</p>
<p>&#8220;And after that the bird said, &#8216;I will come
when you call me.&#8217; I never have seen her
moving overhead; perhaps she is out of sight.
Flocks of birds hover over the world, and watch
it high up where the air is thin. There are
zones, but those in the lowest zone are far out
of sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not been up there. I have no wings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the highest of the birds is the place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
where angels float and gather the children&#8217;s souls
as they are set free.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so that woman told me,&mdash;(Wand, you
bend again, and I will turn at your bending),&mdash;that
woman told me how it was: for when the
new king was born, a black fairy with a smiling
face came and sat within the doorway. She had
a spindle, and would always spin. She wanted
to teach them how to spin, but they did not like
her, and they loved to do nothing at all. So
they turned her out.</p>
<p>&#8220;But after her came a brown fairy, with a
grave face, and she sat on the black fairy&#8217;s stool
and gave them much counsel. They liked that
still less; so they got spindles and spun, for they
said, &#8216;She will go now, and we shall have the
black fairy again.&#8217; When she did not go they
turned her out also, and after her came a white
fairy, and sat in the same seat. She did nothing
at all, and she said nothing at all; but she had
a sorrowful face, and she looked up. So they
were displeased. They turned her out also; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
she went and sat by the edge of the lake with
her two sisters.</p>
<p>&#8220;And everything prospered over all the land;
till, after shearing-time, the shepherds, because
the king was a child, came to his uncle and
said, &#8216;Sir, what shall we do with the old wool,
for the new fleeces are in the bales, and there
is no storehouse to put them in?&#8217; So he said,
&#8216;Throw them into the lake.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And while they threw them in, a great
flock of finches flew to them, and said, &#8216;Give
us some of the wool that you do not want; we
should be glad of it to build our nests with.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;They answered, &#8216;Go and gather for yourselves;
there is wool on every thorn.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the black fairy said, &#8216;They shall be
forgiven this time, because the birds should pick
wool for themselves.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;So the finches flew away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the harvest was over, and the reapers
came and said to the child-king&#8217;s uncle, &#8216;Sir,
what shall we do with the new wheat, for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
old is not half eaten yet, and there is no room
in the granaries?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said, &#8216;Throw that into the lake also.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;While they were throwing it in, there came
a great flight of the wood fairies, fairies of passage
from over the sea. They were in the form
of pigeons, and they alighted and prayed them,
&#8216;O, cousins! we are faint with our long flight;
give us some of that corn which you do not
want, that we may peck it and be refreshed.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they said, &#8216;You may rest on our land,
but our corn is our own. Rest awhile, and go
and get food in your own fields.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the brown fairy said, &#8216;They may be
forgiven this once, but yet it is a great unkindness.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And as they were going to pour in the last
sackful, there passed a poor mortal beggar, who
had strayed in from the men and women&#8217;s world,
and she said, &#8216;Pray give me some of that wheat,
O fairy people! for I am hungry. I have lost
my way, and there is no money to be earned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
here. Give me some of that wheat, that I may
bake cakes, lest I and my baby should starve.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they said, &#8216;What is starve? We never
heard that word before, and we cannot wait while
you explain it to us.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;So they poured it all into the lake; and then
the white fairy said, &#8216;This cannot be forgiven
them&#8217;; and she covered her face with her hands
and wept. Then the black fairy rose and drove
them all before her,&mdash;the prince, with his chief
shepherd and his reapers, his courtiers and his
knights; she drove them into the great bed of
reeds, and no one has ever set eyes on them
since. Then the brown fairy went into the palace
where the king&#8217;s aunt sat, with all her ladies and
her maids about her, and with the child-king on
her knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a very gloomy day.</p>
<p>&#8220;She stood in the middle of the hall, and
said, &#8216;Oh, you cold-hearted and most unkind!
my spell is upon you, and the first ray of sunshine
shall bring it down. Lose your present
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
forms, and be of a more gentle and innocent
race, till a queen of alien birth shall come to
reign over you against her will.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;As she spoke they crept into corners, and
covered the dame&#8217;s head with a veil. And all
that day it was dark and gloomy, and nothing
happened, and all the next day it rained and
rained; and they thrust the dame into a dark
closet, and kept her there for a whole month,
and still not a ray of sunshine came to do them
any damage; but the dame faded and faded in
the dark, and at last they said, &#8216;She must come
out, or she will die; and we do not believe the
sun will ever shine in our country any more.&#8217; So
they let the poor dame come out; and lo! as
she crept slowly forth under the dome, a piercing
ray of sunlight darted down upon her head, and
in an instant they were all changed into deer,
and the child-king too.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are gentle now, and kind; but where
is the prince? where are the fairy knights and
the fairy men?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Wand! why do you turn?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now while Mopsa told her story the wand
continued to bend, and Mopsa, following, was
slowly approaching the foot of a great precipice,
which rose sheer up for more than a hundred
feet. The crowd that followed looked dismayed
at this: they thought the wand must be wrong;
or even if it was right, they could not climb a
precipice.</p>
<p>But still Mopsa walked on blindfold, and the
wand pointed at the rock till it touched it, and
she said, &#8220;Who is stopping me?&#8221;</p>
<p>They told her, and she called to some of her
ladies to untie the handkerchief. Then Mopsa
looked at the rock, and so did the two Jacks.
There was nothing to be seen but a very tiny
hole. The boy-king thought it led to a bees&#8217;
nest, and Jack thought it was a keyhole, for he
noticed in the rock a slight crack which took
the shape of an arched door.</p>
<p>Mopsa looked earnestly at the hole. &#8220;It may
be a keyhole,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but there is no key.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br /><br />FAILURE.</h2>
</div>
<div class='poem' style='width: 25em'><div class='stanza'>
<p>We are much bound to them that do succeed;</p>
<p class='indent2'>But, in a more pathetic sense, are bound</p>
<p class='indent2'>To such as fail. They all our loss expound;</p>
<p>They comfort us for work that will not speed,</p>
<p>And life&mdash;itself a failure. Ay, his deed,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Sweetest in story, who the dusk profound</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of Hades flooded with entrancing sound,</p>
<p>Music&#8217;s own tears, was failure. Doth it read</p>
<p>Therefore the worse? Ah, no! so much to dare,</p>
<p class='indent2'>He fronts the regnant Darkness on its throne.&mdash;</p>
<p>So much to do; impetuous even there,</p>
<p class='indent2'>He pours out love&#8217;s disconsolate sweet moan&mdash;</p>
<p>He wins; but few for that his deed recall:</p>
<p>Its power is in the look which costs him all.</p>
</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>At</span> this moment Jack observed that a strange
woman was standing among them, and that
the trainbearing fairies fell back, as if they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
afraid of her. As no one spoke, he did, and said,
&#8220;Good-morning!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-afternoon!&#8221; she answered, correcting
him. &#8220;I am the black fairy. Work is a fine
thing. Most people in your country can work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two spades,&#8221; continued the fairy
woman, &#8220;one for you, and one for your double.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack took one of the spades,&mdash;it was small,
and was made of silver; but the other Jack said
with scorn,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be a king when I am old enough, and
must I dig like a clown?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; said the black fairy, and
walked away.</p>
<p>Then they all observed that a brown woman
was standing there; and she stepped up and
whispered in the boy-king&#8217;s ear. As he listened
his sullen face became good tempered, and at last
he said, in a gentle tone, &#8220;Jack, I&#8217;m quite ready
to begin if you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where are we to dig?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said a white fairy, stepping up and
setting her foot on the grass just under the little
hole. &#8220;Dig down as deep as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Mopsa and the crowd stood back, and the
two boys began to dig; and greatly they enjoyed
it, for people can dig so fast in Fairyland.</p>
<p>Very soon the hole was so deep that they had
to jump into it, because they could not reach
the bottom with their spades. &#8220;This is very
jolly indeed,&#8221; said Jack, when they had dug so
much deeper that they could only see out of the
hole by standing on tiptoe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said the white fairy; so they dug till
they came to a flat stone, and then she said, &#8220;Now
you can stamp. Stamp on the stone, and don&#8217;t be
afraid.&#8221; So the two Jacks began to stamp, and
in such a little time that she had only half turned
her head round, the flat stone gave way, for there
was a hollow underneath it, and down went the
boys, and utterly disappeared.</p>
<p>Then, while Mopsa and the crowd silently
looked on, the white fairy lightly pushed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
clods of earth towards the hole with the side of
her foot, and in a very few minutes the hole was
filled in, and that so completely and so neatly,
that when she had spread the turf on it, and
given it a pat with her foot, you could not have
told where it had been. Mopsa said not a word,
for no fairy ever interferes with a stronger
fairy; but she looked on earnestly, and when the
white stranger smiled she was satisfied.</p>
<p>Then the white stranger walked away, and
Mopsa and the fairies sat down on a bank under
some splendid cedar-trees. The beautiful castle
looked fairer than ever in the afternoon sunshine;
a lovely waterfall tumbled with a tinkling noise
near at hand, and the bank was covered with
beautiful wild flowers.</p>
<p>They sat for a long while, and no one spoke:
what they were thinking of is not known, but
sweet Mopsa often sighed.</p>
<p>At last a noise,&mdash;a very, very slight noise, as
of the footsteps of people running,&mdash;was heard
inside the rock, and then a little quivering was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
seen in the wand. It quivered more and more as
the sound increased. At last that which had
looked like a door began to shake as if some one
was pushing it from within. Then a noise was
distinctly heard as of a key turning in the hole,
and out burst the two Jacks, shouting for joy,
and a whole troop of knights and squires and
serving-men came rushing wildly forth behind
them.</p>
<p>Oh, the joy of that meeting! who shall describe
it? Fairies by dozens came up to kiss the boy-king&#8217;s
hand, and Jack shook hands with every
one that could reach him. Then Mopsa proceeded
to the castle between the two Jacks, and the
king&#8217;s aunt came out to meet them, and welcomed
her husband with tears of joy; for these
fairies could laugh and cry when they pleased,
and they naturally considered this a great proof
of superiority.</p>
<p>After this a splendid feast was served under the
great dome. The other fairy feasts that Jack had
seen were nothing to it. The prince and his dame
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
sat at one board, but Mopsa sat at the head of the
great table, with the two Jacks, one on each side
of her.</p>
<p>Mopsa was not happy, Jack was sure of that,
for she often sighed; and he thought this strange.
But he did not ask her any questions, and he, with
the boy-king, related their adventures to her: how,
when the stone gave way, they tumbled in and
rolled down a sloping bank till they found themselves
at the entrance of a beautiful cave, which
was all lighted up with torches, and glittering
with stars and crystals of all the colors in the
world. There was a table spread with what
looked like a splendid luncheon in this great cave,
and chairs were set round, but Jack and the boy-king
felt no inclination to eat anything, though
they were hungry, for a whole nation of ants
were creeping up the honey-pots. There were
snails walking about over the table-cloth, and
toads peeping out of some of the dishes.</p>
<p>So they turned away, and, looking for some
other door to lead them farther in, they at last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
found a very small one,&mdash;so small that only one
of them could pass through at a time.</p>
<p>They did not tell Mopsa all that had occurred
on this occasion. It was thus:</p>
<p>The boy-king said, &#8220;I shall go in first, of course,
because of my rank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind. I shall
say to myself that you&#8217;ve gone in first to find the
way for me, because you&#8217;re my double. Besides,
now I think of it, our Queen always goes last in
a procession; so it&#8217;s grand to go last. Pass in,
Jack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered the other Jack; &#8220;now you
have said that I will not. You may go first.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they began to quarrel and argue about this,
and it is impossible to say how long they would
have gone on if they had not begun to hear a
terrible and mournful sort of moaning and groaning,
which frightened them both and instantly
made them friends. They took tight hold of one
another&#8217;s hand, and again there came by a loud
sighing, and a noise of all sorts of lamentation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
and it seemed to reach them through the little
door.</p>
<p>Each of the boys would now have been very
glad to go back, but neither liked to speak. At
last Jack thought anything would be less terrible
than listening to those dismal moans, so he suddenly
dashed through the door, and the other
Jack followed.</p>
<p>There was nothing terrible to be seen. They
found themselves in a place like an immensely
long stable; but it was nearly dark, and when
their eyes got used to the dimness, they saw that
it was strewed with quantities of fresh hay, from
which curious things like sticks stuck up in all
directions. What were they?</p>
<p>&#8220;They are dry branches of trees,&#8221; said the
boy-king.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are table-legs turned upside down,&#8221;
said Jack: but then the other Jack suddenly perceived
the real nature of the thing, and he
shouted out, &#8220;No; they are antlers!&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment he said this the moaning ceased,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
hundreds of beautiful antlered heads were lifted
up, and the two boys stood before a splendid
herd of stags; but they had had hardly time to
be sure of this when the beautiful multitude rose
and fled away into the darkness, leaving the two
boys to follow as well as they could.</p>
<p>They were sure they ought to run after the
herd, and they ran and ran, but they soon lost
sight of it, though they heard far on in front
what seemed at first like a pattering of deer&#8217;s
feet, but the sound changed from time to time.
It became heavier and louder, and then the clattering
ceased, and it was evidently the tramping
of a great crowd of men. At last they heard
words, very glad and thankful words; people
were crying to one another to make haste, lest
the spell should come upon them again. Then
the two Jacks, still running, came into a grand
hall, which was quite full of knights and all sorts
of fairy men, and there was the boy-king&#8217;s uncle,
but he looked very pale. &#8220;Unlock the door!&#8221;
they cried. &#8220;We shall not be safe till we see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
our new Queen. Unlock the door; we see light
coming through the keyhole.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two Jacks came on to the front, and felt
and shook the door. At last the boy-king saw a
little golden key glittering on the floor, just where
the one narrow sunbeam fell that came through
the keyhole; so he snatched it up. It fitted, and
out they all came, as you have been told.</p>
<p>When they had done relating their adventures,
the new Queen&#8217;s health was drunk. And then
they drank the health of the boy-king, who stood
up to return thanks, and, as is the fashion there,
he sang a song. Jack thought it the most ridiculous
song he had ever heard; but as everybody
else looked extremely grave, he tried to be grave
too. It was about Cock-Robin and Jenny Wren,
how they made a wedding feast, and how the
wren said she should wear her brown gown, and
the old dog brought a bone to the feast.</p>
<div class='poem' style='width: 25em'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;He had brought them,&#8221; he said, &#8220;some meat on a bone:</p>
<p>They were welcome to pick it or leave it alone.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>The fairies were very attentive to this song;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
they seemed, if one may judge by their looks,
to think it was rather a serious one. Then they
drank Jack&#8217;s health, and afterwards looked at
him as if they expected him to sing too; but as
he did not begin, he presently heard them whispering,
and one asking another, &#8220;Do you think
he knows manners?&#8221;</p>
<p>So he thought he had better try what he could
do, and he stood up and sang a song that he
had often heard his nurse sing in the nursery at
home.</p>
<div class='poem' style='width: 25em'><div class='stanza'>
<p>One morning, oh! so early, my belovèd, my belovèd,</p>
<p>All the birds were singing blithely, as if never they would cease;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a thrush sang in my garden, &#8220;Hear the story, hear the story!&#8221;</p>
<p class='indent10'>And the lark sang, &#8220;Give us glory!&#8221;</p>
<p class='indent10'>And the dove said, &#8220;Give us peace!&#8221;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Then I listened, oh! so early, my belovèd, my belovèd,</p>
<p>To that murmur from the woodland of the dove, my dear, the dove;</p>
<p>When the nightingale came after, &#8220;Give us fame to sweeten duty!&#8221;</p>
<p class='indent10'>When the wren sang, &#8220;Give us beauty!&#8221;</p>
<p class='indent10'>She made answer, &#8220;Give us love!&#8221;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>Sweet is spring, and sweet the morning, my belovèd, my belovèd;</p>
<p>Now for us doth spring, doth morning, wait upon the year&#8217;s increase,</p>
<p>And my prayer goes up, &#8220;Oh, give us, crowned in youth with marriage glory,</p>
<p class='indent10'>Give for all our life&#8217;s dear story,</p>
<p class='indent10'>Give us love, and give us peace!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;A very good song too,&#8221; said the dame, at
the other end of the table; &#8220;only you made a
mistake in the first verse. What the dove really
said was, no doubt, &#8216;Give us peas.&#8217; All kinds
of doves and pigeons are very fond of peas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t peas, though,&#8221; said Jack. However,
the court historian was sent for to write down
the song, and he came with a quill pen, and
wrote it down as the dame said it ought to be.</p>
<p>Now all this time Mopsa sat between the
two Jacks, and she looked very mournful,&mdash;she
hardly said a word.</p>
<p>When the feast was over, and everything had
vanished, the musicians came in, for there was
to be dancing; but while they were striking up,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
the white fairy stepped in, and, coming up, whispered
something in Jack&#8217;s ear; but he could not
hear what she said, so she repeated it more
slowly, and still he could neither hear nor understand
it.</p>
<p>Mopsa did not seem to like the white fairy;
she leaned her face on her hand and sighed;
but when she found that Jack could not hear
the message, she said, &#8220;That is well. Cannot
you let things alone for this one day?&#8221; The
fairy then spoke to Mopsa, but she would not
listen; she made a gesture of dislike and moved
away. So then this strange fairy turned and
went out again, but on the door-step she looked
round, and beckoned to Jack to come to her.
So he did; and then, as they two stood together
outside, she made him understand what she had
said. It was this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Her name was Jenny, her name was Jenny.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Jack understood what she said he felt so
sorrowful; he wondered why she had told him,
and he longed to stay in that great place with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
Queen Mopsa,&mdash;his own little Mopsa, whom
he had carried in his pocket, and taken care of,
and loved.</p>
<p>He walked up and down, up and down, outside,
and his heart swelled and his eyes filled with
tears. The bells had said he was to go home, and
the fairy had told him how to go. Mopsa did not
need him, she had so many people to take care
of her; and then there was that boy, so exactly
like himself that she would not miss him. Oh,
how sorrowful it all was! Had he really come
up the fairy river, and seen those strange countries,
and run away with Mopsa over those dangerous
mountains, only to bring her to the very place she
wished to fly from, and there to leave her, knowing
that she wanted him no more, and that she
was quite content?</p>
<p>No; Jack felt that he could not do that. &#8220;I
will stay,&#8221; he said; &#8220;they cannot make me leave
her. That would be too unkind.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke, he drew near to the great yawning
door, and looked in. The fairy folk were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
singing inside; he could hear their pretty chirping
voices, and see their beautiful faces, but he
could not bear it, and he turned away.</p>
<p>The sun began to get low, and all the west was
dyed with crimson. Jack dried his eyes, and, not
liking to go in, took one turn more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go in,&#8221; he said; &#8220;there is nothing to
prevent me.&#8221; He set his foot on the step of the
door, and while he hesitated Mopsa came out to
meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; she said, in a sweet mournful tone of
voice. But he could not make any answer; he
only looked at her earnestly, because her lovely
eyes were not looking at him, but far away
towards the west.</p>
<p>&#8220;He lives there,&#8221; she said, as if speaking to
herself. &#8220;He will play there again, in his father&#8217;s
garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she brought her eyes down slowly from
the rose-flush in the cloud, and looked at him and
said, &#8220;Jack.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack; &#8220;I am here. What is it
that you wish to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>She answered, &#8220;I am come to give you back
your kiss.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she stooped forward as she stood on the
step, and kissed him, and her tears fell on his
cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farewell!&#8221; she said, and she turned and went
up the steps and into the great hall; and while
Jack gazed at her as she entered, and would
fain have followed, but could not stir, the great
doors closed together again, and he was left
outside.</p>
<p>Then he knew, without having been told, that
he should never enter them any more. He stood
gazing at the castle; but it was still,&mdash;no more
fairy music sounded.</p>
<p>How beautiful it looked in the evening sunshine,
and how Jack cried!</p>

</div>
<p>Suddenly he perceived that reeds were growing
up between him and the great doors: the grass,
which had all day grown about the steps, was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
getting taller; it had long spear-like leaves, it
pushed up long pipes of green stem, and they
whistled.</p>
<p>They were up to his ankles, they were presently
up to his waist; soon they were as high as his
head. He drew back that he might see over them;
they sprang up faster as he retired, and again he
went back. It seemed to him that the castle also
receded; there was a long reach of these great
reeds between it and him, and now they were
growing behind also, and on all sides of him. He
kept moving back and back: it was of no use,
they sprang up and grew yet more tall, till very
shortly the last glimpse of the fairy castle was
hidden from his sorrowful eyes.</p>
<p>The sun was just touching the tops of the
purple mountains when Jack lost sight of Mopsa&#8217;s
home; but he remembered how he had penetrated
the bed of reeds in the morning, and he
hoped to have the same good fortune again. So
on and on he walked, pressing his way among
them as well as he could, till the sun went down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
behind the mountains, and the rosy sky turned
gold color, and the gold began to burn itself
away, and then all on a sudden he came to the
edge of the reed-bed, and walked out upon a
rising ground.</p>
<p>Jack ran up it, looking for the castle. He
could not see it, so he climbed a far higher hill;
still he could not see it. At last, after a toilsome
ascent to the very top of the green mountain,
he saw the castle lying so far, so very far off,
that its peaks and its battlements were on the
edge of the horizon, and the evening mist rose
while he was gazing, so that all its outlines
were lost, and very soon they seemed to mingle
with the shapes of the hill and the forest, till
they had utterly vanished away.</p>
<p>Then he threw himself down on the short
grass. The words of the white fairy sounded in
his ears, &#8220;Her name was Jenny&#8221;; and he burst
into tears again, and decided to go home.</p>
<p>He looked up into the rosy sky, and held out
his arms, and called, &#8220;Jenny! O Jenny! come.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></div>
<p>In a minute or two he saw a little black mark
overhead, a small speck, and it grew larger, and
larger, and larger still, as it fell headlong down
like a stone. In another instant he saw a red
light and a green light, then he heard the winnowing
noise of the bird&#8217;s great wings, and she
alighted at his feet, and said, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to go home,&#8221; said Jack, hanging
down his head and speaking in a low voice, for
his heart was heavy because of his failure.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is well,&#8221; answered the bird. She took
Jack on her back, and in three minutes they
were floating among the clouds.</p>
<p>As Jack&#8217;s feet were lifted up from Fairyland
he felt a little consoled. He began to have a
curious feeling, as if this had all happened a
good while ago, and then half the sorrow he
had felt faded into wonder, and the feeling still
grew upon him that these things had passed some
great while since, so that he repeated to himself,
&#8220;It was a long time ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he fell asleep, and did not dream at all,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
nor know anything more till the bird woke
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wake up now, Jack,&#8221; she said; &#8220;we are at
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So soon!&#8221; said Jack, rubbing his eyes. &#8220;But
it is evening; I thought it would be morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairy time is always six hours in advance
of your time,&#8221; said the bird. &#8220;I see glowworms
down in the hedge, and the moon is just rising.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were falling so fast that Jack dared not
look; but he saw the church, and the wood,
and his father&#8217;s house, which seemed to be
starting up to meet him. In two seconds more
the bird alighted, and he stepped down from her
back into the deep grass of his father&#8217;s meadow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by!&#8221; she said; &#8220;make haste and run
in, for the dews are falling&#8221;; and before he
could ask her one question, or even thank her,
she made a wide sweep over the grass, beat
her magnificent wings, and soared away.</p>
<p>It was all very extraordinary, and Jack felt
shy and ashamed; but he knew he must go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
home, so he opened the little gate that led into
the garden, and stole through the shrubbery,
hoping that his footsteps would not be heard.</p>
<p>Then he came out on the lawn, where the
flower-beds were, and he observed that the
drawing-room window was open, so he came
softly towards it and peeped in.</p>
<p>His father and mother were sitting there. Jack
was delighted to see them, but he did not say
a word, and he wondered whether they would
be surprised at his having stayed away so long.
The bird had said that they would not.</p>
<p>He drew a little nearer. His mother sat with
her back to the open window, but a candle was
burning, and she was reading aloud. Jack listened
as she read, and knew that this was not in
the least like anything that he had seen in Fairyland,
nor the reading like anything that he had
heard, and he began to forget the boy-king, and
the apple-woman, and even his little Mopsa, more
and more.</p>
<p>At last his father noticed him. He did not look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
at all surprised, but just beckoned to him with
his finger to come in. So Jack did, and got upon
his father&#8217;s knee, where he curled himself up comfortably,
laid his head on his father&#8217;s waistcoat,
and wondered what he would think if he should
be told about the fairies in somebody else&#8217;s waistcoat
pocket. He thought, besides, what a great
thing a man was; he had never seen anything so
large in Fairyland, nor so important; so, on the
whole, he was glad he had come back, and felt
very comfortable. Then his mother, turning over
the leaf, lifted up her eyes and looked at Jack,
but not as if she was in the least surprised, or
more glad to see him than usual; but she smoothed
the leaf with her hand, and began again to
read, and this time it was about the Shepherd
Lady:&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem' style='font-style: italic'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>I.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Who pipes upon the long green hill,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Where meadow grass is deep?</p>
<p>The white lamb bleats but followeth on&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Follow the clean white sheep.</p>
<p>The dear white lady in yon high tower,</p>
<p class='indent2'>She hearkeneth in her sleep.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>All in long grass the piper stands,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Goodly and grave is he;</p>
<p>Outside the tower, at dawn of day,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The notes of his pipe ring free.</p>
<p>A thought from his heart doth reach to hers:</p>
<p class='indent2'>&#8220;Come down, O lady! to me.&#8221;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>She lifts her head, she dons her gown:</p>
<p class='indent2'>Ah! the lady is fair;</p>
<p>She ties the girdle on her waist,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And binds her flaxen hair,</p>
<p>And down she stealeth, down and down,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Down the turret stair.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Behold him! With the flock he wons</p>
<p class='indent2'>Along yon grassy lea.</p>
<p>&#8220;My shepherd lord, my shepherd love,</p>
<p class='indent2'>What wilt thou, then, with me?</p>
<p>My heart is gone out of my breast,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And followeth on to thee.&#8221;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p class='center'>II.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;The white lambs feed in tender grass:</p>
<p class='indent2'>With them and thee to bide,</p>
<p>How good it were,&#8221; she saith at noon;</p>
<p class='indent2'>&#8220;Albeit the meads are wide.</p>
<p>Oh! well is me&#8221; she saith when day</p>
<p class='indent2'>Draws on to eventide.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Hark! hark! the shepherd&#8217;s voice. Oh, sweet!</p>
<p class='indent2'>Her tears drop down like rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take now this crook, my chosen, my fere</p>
<p class='indent2'>And tend the flock full fain;</p>
<p>Feed them, O lady, and lose not one,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Till I shall come again.&#8221;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Right soft her speech: &#8220;My will is thine,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And my reward thy grace!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gone are his footsteps over the hill,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Withdrawn his goodly face;</p>
<p>The mournful dusk begins to gather,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The daylight wanes apace.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p class='center'>III.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>On sunny slopes, ah! long the lady</p>
<p class='indent2'>Feedeth her flock at noon;</p>
<p>She leads them down to drink at eve</p>
<p class='indent2'>Where the small rivulets croon.</p>
<p>All night her locks are wet with dew,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Her eyes outwatch the moon.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Over the hills her voice is heard,</p>
<p class='indent2'>She sings when light doth wane:</p>
<p>&#8220;My longing heart is full of love.</p>
<p class='indent2'>When shall my loss be gain?</p>
<p>My shepherd lord, I see him not,</p>
<p class='indent2'>But he will come again.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>When she had finished, Jack lifted his face
and said, &#8220;Mamma!&#8221; Then she came to him
and kissed him, and his father said, &#8220;I think
it must be time this man of ours was in bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he looked earnestly at them both, and as
they still asked him no questions, he kissed and
wished them good-night; and his mother said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
there were some strawberries on the sideboard in
the dining-room, and he might have them for his
supper.</p>
<p>So he ran out into the hall, and was delighted
to find all the house just as usual, and after he
had looked about him he went into his own
room, and said his prayers. Then he got into
his little white bed, and comfortably fell asleep.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all.</p>
